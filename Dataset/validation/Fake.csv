Great disrespect! Next time NFL should suspend him for remainder of season. Attendance and ratings way down,  Trump tweeted on Monday morning.

Lynch starts each sentence in her tweet with lower case letters and ends her tweet with a sentence followed by a space, a comma, and two exclamation points for emphasis.

 Paul Ryan Attacks President Obama For Being ‘Distracted’ By Murdered Children,"On Monday, President Obama announced that he was expanding background checks to close the  gun show loophole  and ordering federal authorities to more aggressively enforce the current gun laws. Republicans, predictably, went insane and started screaming  tyranny  and  unconstitutional.  In the world of the GOP gun nut the president   or any lawmaker for that matter   should not ever, EVER try to make this country a safer place because .FREEDOM!One day after announcing his executive action on gun laws, President Obama held a press conference to explain why he felt it was important that he take action. The president was introduced by Mark Barden, whose son Daniel was killed in the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, and when Obama spoke of the twenty children who died that day he broke down and cried in front of the nation. Callous Republicans immediately accused him of  faking  his tears for political gain   new Speaker of the House Paul Ryan was one of those people.Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) spoke to Yahoo News s Katie Couric, on Thursday, where he was asked if he was moved by the president s tears on Tuesday. The Republican responded: I was affected by it, but I thought we should ve had the same kind of reaction when James Foley was beheaded, when San Bernardino and Paris occurred. That s the kind of reaction I had when those occurred. Really? He can t understand why the news of twenty FIRST-GRADERS being murdered in their classrooms was a little bit more emotional? These children, six-and-seven years old, were itty bitty and each of their bodies had between three and eleven bullets in them; they were literally riddled with bullets. All of the mass shootings we have experienced over the last decade and a half have been horrifying, but this one was especially hard because the majority of the victims were so small. But Paul Ryan can t understand why this particular one makes the president cry. Okay.Ryan wasn t done yet, he went on to say that the president was using gun control as a  distraction : What I think he s trying to do is distract from basically his failed policies I think the president should put as much effort into going after homegrown jihadists and going after terrorist infiltration of our refugee network and going after defeating ISIS as he is in trying to frustrate the law-abiding citizens  Second Amendment rights. This scumbag actually believes that trying to prevent more gun massacres is the president trying to distract from  real  problems. As if keeping our kids alive isn t a big deal. He thinks our time would be better spent going after the mythical ISIS fighters who are hiding among refugees or  homegrown jihadists ? Why? Because going after  law-abiding  citizens like Dylann Roof, Adam Lanza and the hundreds of other white American terrorists we have in this country is tyranny. Seems legit.Ryan opened his mouth and proved to us, once again, why it is so damn important that we get off of our sofas and vote next November. If we sit at home, we are just giving the Gun Nuts of America  license to kill more of our kids and loved ones. We are one of the most powerful countries in the world and we can t even send our children to school and know that they will come back to us. The United States has become a war zone and the weapons of choice are as easy to buy as toilet paper. How scary is that? Murica!Featured image via Gage Skidmore"
" As World Trade Center Fell, Donald Trump Boasted His Tower Was Now The Biggest In Manhattan","September 11 was arguably the worst day in American history. All Americans were shell-shocked, fearful, and lost in grief and confusion.Well, almost all Americans were grief stricken, except of course Donald Trump. In his typical form, Trump used an unimaginable horror to prop himself up and pat himself on the back.As the World Trade Center collapsed to the ground, Trump, in a by-phone T.V. interview, boasted that his building, 40 Wall Street, was now the tallest building in lower Manhattan.Reporter: You have one of the landmark buildings down in the financial district there, 40 Wall Street   uh   did you have any damage? What s happened down there?Trump: Oh, it s an amazing phone call I made, 40 Wall Street actually was the second tallest building in downtown Manhattan and it was actually before the World Trade Center was the tallest, and when they built the World Trade Center it became known as the second tallest. But now it s the tallest.Congratulations, Trump. As thousands of people lie dead in a mast of rubble and debris, you single handedly turn a national tragedy into praise for yourself and your buildings.Imagine if Hillary Clinton, who was Senator of New York at the time, had said something so incredibly offensive, so devoid of sympathy or empathy for New Yorkers.Of course his supporters   Republicans who exploit 9/11 to draw out our fears   will dismiss this as another liberal character assault. Coupled with his lies about Muslims, the theft of his  charity  for 9/11 survivors, it should come as no surprise that Donald Trump did not care on iota about what happened.Only a egomaniacal narcissist would take the opportunity to plug in his business as being the biggest (and thus the best) as an iconic hallmark of the world crumbles.Watch the exchange for yourself and share it with all your  patriotic  Trump-supporting friends and family. Show them how hereally felt on 9/11:There s audio of Trump patting himself on the back for having the tallest building in Manhattan after the WTC fell! pic.twitter.com/vQFFcAibQz  Josh Jordan (@NumbersMuncher) September 11, 2016Here s your candidate, Republicans, in all his glory.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images"
OBAMA FAN CLUB PRESIDENT GEORGE CLOONEY Tells France: “There’s Not Going To Be A President Trump” [VIDEO],"There s nothing quite like an arrogant actor who lives in Europe, supports Hillary, blames the press for making Trump popular, and for not properly vetting him, while hanging out at the White House with the least vetted President in American history.George Clooney is making his disdain for Donald Trump known not just here in the United States but also overseas.The actor was interviewed by members of the international press at the Cannes Film Festival on Thursday afternoon, and took some time to share with them his opinion of Trump. There s not going to be a President Donald Trump,  said Clooney, who held a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton last month in Los Angeles where tickets reportedly went for $353,400 per couple. That s not going to happen. Fear is not going to be something that drives our country. We re not going to be scared of Muslims or immigrants or women. We re not actually afraid of anything. That whole  We re not afraid of Muslims  thing ought to go over pretty well with the victims and families of victims who have been attacked in Paris twice over the past couple of years. Tell that to French residents who live in or near  no-go-zones  George. Of course, you wouldn t know, because you have the best security detail money can buy hypocrite!Clooney, who was on the Croisette to promote his film Money Monster, went on to say;  Trump is actually a result in many ways of the fact that much of the news programs didn t follow up and ask tough questions.

 Target Just Made A Major Move That’s Going To Blow Conservative Minds (VIDEO),"Conservatives, who are notoriously anti-labor, are going to be outraged by the move Target just made.Target will be raising their national minimum wage to $15 by 2020, starting with an immediate raise next month. Here s more via Jessica Castro, an anchor for ABC7 out of the Bay Area:#breaking Target will increase its minimum wage nationwide to $15 by 2020; If you work there, this means RAISES next month! #livedesk pic.twitter.com/0BXcHJoBdC  Jessica Castro (@JessicaABC7) September 25, 2017Republicans have repeatedly tried to make the case that raising wages kills jobs and raises prices, but that s not true. Target is making the right call. The current federal minimum wage, at $7.25, is extremely low compared to historic averages when adjusted for inflation.In fact, when you adjust for inflation, the minimum wage has steadily dropped since 1968.Republicans also try to make the case that most minimum wage workers have just entered the workforce and are not supporting families on their income (i.e. are students). This, too, is false. Less than half of minimum wage workers are aged 16-24. Additionally, tens of millions of hardworking Americans are paid nearly minimum wage, and would also be affected by proposed raises. It s not high schoolers with after-school jobs being paid minimum wage   it s anybody working a job at a business that can get away with shifting the burden of its employees to the public.And make no mistake   if you re a taxpayer, you re supporting underpaid employees. People working full-time (or part-time and can t get more hours) who are under the poverty line are eligible for benefits, and many choose to take them, being partial to eating and whatnot. That means if a business isn t paying their employees enough to eat, the government has to subsidize that employee. If a business can t afford a living wage, it has no right to exist.From Pew Research:While the idea of raising the minimum wage is broadly popular, a Pew Research Center survey this past August found clear partisan and racial differences in support. Overall, 52% of people favored increasing the federal minimum to $15 an hour, but that idea was favored by just 21% of Trump supporters (versus 82% of Clinton backers). And while large majorities of blacks and Hispanics supported a $15 federal minimum wage, 54% of whites opposed it.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images"
GREAT! PRO-COAL OKLAHOMA AG Tapped For Head Of EPA," When the Environmental Protection Agency proposed rules regulating carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants, Scott Pruitt sued. When the Justice Department offered legal status to young undocumented immigrants, Scott Pruitt sued. And when the Obama administration sought to give tax credits to states that hadn t set up their own health insurance exchanges, Scott Pruitt sued.Since becoming Oklahoma attorney general in 2010, Pruitt has filed or joined lawsuits against federal agencies at least a dozen times. Even when Oklahoma isn t an actual party in litigation, the state often submits a legal brief against the federal government. Besides air pollution, immigration and health care, Pruitt has fought federal laws and regulations on banking, contraception and endangered species. These days, whenever states go to court against the Obama administration, the chances are that Pruitt is somehow involved.Not that Pruitt is alone. During Obama s presidency, the entire cadre of Republican attorneys general (27 at present) has coordinated cases against federal agencies at an unprecedented pace. But Pruitt is at the center of the action. He has set up a first-in-the-nation  federalism unit,  which seeks to combat instances of federal overreach by every possible means.Read more: Governing"
 Bizarre Late Night Statement Proves Deputy AG Is Just Another Water Carrier For Trump,"Donald Trump s administration and White House is the leakiest in living memory. This is because even his own staff knows that he is incompetent, intemperate, childish, narcissistic, and completely unfit for the office he holds. Despite the fact that they all know this, the sycophants around him just keep on doing his bidding   and they keep leaking. These leaks seem to be worrying Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein   or rather, likely Trump s open rage with regards to them has forced Rosenstein s hand.Instead of defending the integrity of Special Counsel Robert Mueller as Trump and his minions have spent the last few days attacking this decorated public servant, Rosenstein instead decided to issue a bizarre statement late Thursday night that shows that he, too, is now shilling for Trump. The statement attacks the credibility of anonymous sources, saying:Americans should exercise caution before accepting as true any stories attributed to anonymous  officials,  particularly when they do not identify the country   let alone the branch of agency of government   with which the alleged sources supposedly are affiliated. Americans should be skeptical about anonymous allegations. The Department of Justice has a long established policy to neither confirm nor deny such allegations.Fired U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara pointed out that Rosenstein should be defending Special Counsel Mueller instead of shilling for Trump:Where is Rod Rosenstein's overdue statement responding to the President's repeated attacks on his appointment of Robert Mueller? pic.twitter.com/y7dwtWTQ4G  Preet Bharara (@PreetBharara) June 16, 2017This is beyond strange. The Department of Justice is not supposed to be politicized, but still the people therein serve at the pleasure of the president. More than likely, Trump ordered Rosenstein to do this, since so many damning stories about the Russia investigation are coming out on an almost hourly basis. Trump is reportedly completely obsessed with the Russia story, and still hasn t let go of the idea of somehow getting rid of Special Counsel Robert Mueller. In fact, the only reason Mueller is still there is because White House aides talked Trump off the ledge when he was about to order his firing.Conservative commentator Bill Kristol has an excellent theory as to what is going on with Rosenstein s behavior, and it s terrible for the nation:The Rosenstein statement suggests there must be a heck of a Trump story coming based on alleged information from anonymous foreign officials  Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) June 16, 2017In the Age of Trump, the independence of the Department of Justice is definitely shot, and this proves it. While it was clear that Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was a part of Trump s campaign and one of his staunchest supporters was nothing but a Trump shill, we had all hoped that Sessions  recusal from the Russia investigation and Rosenstein s taking over would give the whole situation a bit more credibility, but no.All I can say is thank goodness for Robert Mueller. Hopefully, firing him would be a bridge too far   even for Congressional Republicans.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images"

AFTER GM’S TAXPAYER BAILOUT AND $10 BILLION IN FORGIVEN DEBT…Cars Now Made In China [Video],"Was the GM bailout REALLY about American jobs? The taxpayers were sold a bill of goods on the GM bailout and still haven t seen anything but jobs going overseas. The American worker and American taxpayer deserve better!In 2016, General Motors will roll out for the first time in the United States a new model of Buick built exclusively in China: the Buick Envision.It s the first time the iconic American auto manufacturer will sell cars built in China in the United States since receiving a sizable taxpayer-funded bailout at the end of the George W. Bush administration and beginning of the Barack Obama administration.The Buick Envision which was available in China for purchase as far back as 2014 will make its official debut in the United States in the summer of 2016.The Buick Envision bills itself  a luxury crossover designed to turn heads and welcome you in. A quick search of  Buick Envision  leads to the Buick Envision s website where one can explore all the features and design of the vehicle. The website doesn t appear to make any reference to the fact that the Envision is manufactured in China.The issue of U.S. auto manufacturers moving production facilities overseas has taken a center stage this presidential election, with the rise of both billionaire Donald Trump in the Republican Party and of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT)16% of Vermont in the Democratic Party.Trump has drawn attention to GM competitor Ford for the company s decision to move manufacturing to Mexico, but Ford wasn t the recipient of a taxpayer-funded bailout. Sanders, meanwhile, has used his opposition to the bailouts to show that he isn t influenced by crony capitalism all while former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has tried to take credit for saving the auto industry with her support of the bailout.Breitbart News reached out to American Jobs Alliance to get its reaction to GM s decision to import Chinese-produced cars.  When the taxpayers bailed out General Motors, we were told it was all about saving jobs in America. Now GM turns around and throws Americans under the wheels of Buicks made in China. Where does it stop? Will General Motors build Cadillacs, Chevys and GMC trucks in China next?  Curtis Ellis executive director American Jobs Alliance told Breitbart News.General Motors has also announced plans to sell a Chinese manufactured hybrid Cadillac, the CT6 in American markets. Flint was known for decades as Buick City. It s now jobless, bankrupt and destitute,  Ellis continued.Read more: Breitbart"
 Republican Senators Don’t Want Ted Cruz Anywhere Near Their Re-Election Campaigns,"Ted Cruz thinks he could be an asset to the campaigns of his fellow Republican senators. There s just one problem, though: most of them don t like him.Republicans currently face an uphill climb this year, especially with Donald Trump at the top of the 2016 ballot. The nomination of Trump presents a major problem for Republicans who hope to keep their seats or take seats away from Democrats.Indeed, instead of riding Trump s coattails to victory, Republicans are looking at down-ballot rejection as people associate them with the Republican nominee and his vile campaign.Despite being destroyed by Trump, Texas Senator Ted Cruz wants to lend a hand to his colleagues. That can go a long way toward establishing good relationships,  one Cruz adviser told The Hill.  At the same time, though, I d be wildly surprised if he suddenly started moderating his principles just to get along. Establishing good rapport with colleagues is incredibly crucial to running for higher office. But Ted Cruz has alienated and pissed off most of his Senate colleagues because of his aggressive losing strategies in recent years, the biggest of which is undoubtedly the government shutdown in 2013.Cruz incited the shutdown because he thought it would force President Obama to dismantle Obamacare. In the end, it was a PR nightmare for Republicans as the American people rightfully blamed them for shutting the government down.But the Cruz adviser thinks his colleagues will be interested in taking Cruz s help. I think politicians are practical people,  he said.  They re going to be pretty interested in the kind of support he can give them I think fewer people would say they don t want him now. Unfortunately for Cruz, he seriously underestimates just how much his colleagues loathe him.As it stands, incumbent Republicans facing tough re-election battles don t want Ted Cruz making their lives more difficult.When asked by The Hill if she would accept help from Ted Cruz, New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte said,  Uh, no. I don t think I d ask anyone to come up, generally, other than I had [Sens.] Joni [Ernst (Iowa)] and Shelley [Moore Capito (W.Va.)] up,  she continued.  This is about me campaigning for New Hampshire. I m going to be focusing on my campaign for me. It s not a reflection on him, or anyone else he hasn t contacted me, but I m sure there s a lot of different races out there. In other words, please don t come to New Hampshire, Ted.In Pennsylvania, Senator Pat Toomey also faces a tough campaign, but that doesn t mean he wants Cruz there to make it worse.[Cruz is] not going to [be] into what my campaign is doing,  Toomey insisted.And then there is Arizona Senator John McCain, who has famously referred to Cruz as a  whacko bird.  Yeah, he definitely does not want Cruz stumping for him in his home state.McCain said he only seeks help from people he is close to.  I m not close to Sen. Cruz,  McCain declared.So it looks like many Republicans would rather not have Cruz s support, which isn t surprising considering how extreme he is on several issues.Frankly, if Cruz wanted his colleagues to be more enthusiastic, perhaps he should have thought about that before becoming the most annoying voice in the Senate.Featured Image: Spencer Platt/Getty Images"

NATIONAL ARCHIVES MISSING Massive Data From Clinton White House Records,"The National Archives inspector general investigated the theft. Later emails released by the State Department do not indicate if the federal government ever found the hard drive.There s also the separate case of Sandy Berger who literally stuck documents in his clothes and left the National Archives with them. He was later found cutting the documents up with scissors! It s understood that he wanted to destroy any papers with writing/notes written in the margins. He was the National Security advisor for the Clinton administration and it appears he was a good and loyal soldier to the Clintons when he destroyed evidence These two case of stolen documents have not been solved and we feel it s yet another case of a Clinton coverup A newly released email from the State Department shows that Hillary Clinton was informed in April 2009 of a massive theft of data pertaining to former President Bill Clinton s White House records.On April 13, 2009, Clinton attorney Cheryl Mills informed newly sworn-in Secretary of State Hillary Clinton via email that the National Archives could not account for a two-terabyte hard drive. The drive may contain a wide range of memos, emails, and other electronic documents from the Clinton White House.  The hard drive contained information from the administration of her husband, former President Bill Clinton.The email was made public from State Department files on Thursday as part of an ongoing release of recovered emails that had been previously deleted from Clinton s private server.The forwarded email said the National Archives had a duplicate and was examining it to know what was stolen. It was stolen or misplaced between Jan. 30, 2009, and March 24, 2009.The possible data losses were all serious but only three documents were classified. Social Security numbers and dates of births may have been lost to thieves. Political information may have been stolen too. Two terabytes is a very very large amount of data; the drive may contain a wide range of memos, emails, and other electronic documents from the Clinton White House,  wrote Blake Roberts, deputy associate White House counsel for President Barack Obama.  All the material is unclassified, except for three documents which Bill Leary has examined and does not believe present any significant risk. But the loss was still serious. Based on its analysis, NARA (National Archives) believes the drive contains other sensitive material, including: There is at least a 50% likelihood that the personal information (including DOB and SSN) of all individuals placed through the Clinton Presidential Personnel Office was on the lost hard drive,  wrote Roberts.  There is a 90% likelihood that the personal information (including DOB and SSN) of all Clinton WH staff was on the lost hard drive. There is a 100% chance that some of it was on the lost hard drive. The three classified documents were authored by Lael Brainard, then a top nominee for the Department of the Treasury, Roberts wrote. There are almost certainly records from many other White House officials,  he said.The National Archives inspector general investigated the theft. Later emails released by the State Department do not indicate if the federal government ever found the hard drive. The federal government said they would notify affected people of the breach.The National Archives later did issue a press release on July 16, 2009, updating the public on the search for the hard drive. It offered a reward of $50,000. It also said 15,750 individuals had to be notified by mail of the possible theft.It s not clear why the hard drive was stolen eight years after Bill Clinton left office, and at the start of a new Democratic administration that included his wife, Hillary Clinton, as secretary of state.Theft of records from the National Archives had happened before.The late Sandy Berger, Bill Clinton s national security adviser from 1997 to 2001, removed several documents from the National Archives between Sept. 2, 2003, and Oct. 2, 2003.Berger removed the classified documents from the National Archives by sneaking them out in his socks and pants. Berger then stored and retained such documents at his place of employment. He pleaded guilty in 2005 but received no prison time, according to CNN."
 National Park Service Officials HILARIOUSLY Troll Trump Over Silencing Government Agencies (TWEETS),"Trump may be working to silence government agencies like the Department of the Interior, home to the National Park Service, as well as the EPA and the USDA s science and research office, but some government employees are not having it. Operating anonymously, a group of rangers from the National Park Service, with the help of some friends, are running a Twitter account that s going after Trump s efforts to muzzle science.The name on the account is AltUSNatParkService. They ve been around since 2015, but only became well known over the last day or so as Trump worked to remove scientific information from the White House website, and seems to be ordering any agency or department that publishes climate science to shut it.In addition to posting photos from our beautiful national parks, these rangers have also launched a very obvious offensive effort against Herr Trump by being a veritable fount of climate science.These are people who will not be silenced.These are people who will not allow their colleagues to be silenced either.And besides the climate science they re tweeting, they re also taking very pointed digs at Trump.

 Dianne Feinstein: Trump Is ‘Splitting’ The United States Apart,"Senator Dianne Feinstein went on Fox News this Sunday and ripped President Trump a new one.Pointing out the rank hypocrisy over Trump s executive actions and how Republicans treated President Obama, Feinstein called on the president to unite the country. Instead of uniting, Feinstein said, he s splitting it apart even more:You ve got people in the streets here. This president has not brought this nation together. He says he s working for his base. Well, there are a majority of people who are outside of that base. My best advice has been, and I was able to say this to him directly,  Please Mr. President, you have to bring this country together.  What he s doing is splitting it apart.Currently, the majority of the United States has an unfavorable view of Trump, who set a record for quickest descent into net negative approval ratings over 50 percent. In contrast, it took President Obama almost 1,000 days to reach that point. Trump did it in eight.Feinstein also blasted Trump for his immigration ban, telling Chris Wallace that he is  not a dictator  and that the Supreme Court will ultimately decide if his executive action is unconstitutional.Similarly, the majority of Americans are sharply disapproving of his immigration executive order, and his handling of terrorism, national security, and immigrant, all key tenets to his 2016 campaign.The most shocking statistic comes from Public Policy Polling, which found 40 percent of the American public wants to impeach President Trump. That number is up 5 points from a similar question asked just a week ago. In comparison, it took 16 months after Watergate for the American public to reach that number in support of Nixon s resignation. Trump s done it in two weeks.Not surprisingly, 88-92 percent of Republicans support of the job President Trump is doing. Only 7-10 percent of Democrats believe so. And every major poll has shown independent voters to be sharply divided, with all polls tilting negative.Senator Feinstein is right: President Trump is splitting this country apart all to appease the small minority who voted for him. All his promises of being the president who bridges the two Americas has completely fallen flat.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images"
“Unvetted” Illegals Turn Germany Into A Third-World Trash Heap…Sound Familiar? [Video],"Take Notes America! Germany s Angela Merkel has just promised to dial back on immigration but it s really too late now as you can see in this video from Vlad Tepes: Quantifying the Impact of Border Trash:Apprehensions of individuals by the U.S. Border Patrol as a result of illegal immigration vary every year. Current U.S. Border Patrol statistics indicate that in federal fiscal year 2015, which ended on September 30, approximately 63,400 border crossers were apprehended in the Tucson Sector, which doesn t count the many others who get through. The border crossers leave approximately six to eight pounds of trash in the desert during his or her journey. The cost of disposing of this trash is high for local communities. Landfill fees range from $37 to $49 per ton in Southern Arizona. These fees do not include costs for materials, equipment, labor and transportation for the collection and transfer of the trash to the landfill."
 White Supremacists Robocall For Trump Ahead Of Super Tuesday (AUDIO),"A Super PAC representing white nationalists is robocalling voters in Vermont and Minnesota, urging them to vote for Donald Trump.According to Minnesota s StarTribune, the American National Super PAC is not being particularly discriminate with the calls. Democratic voter Roberta Maki received what she described as a  shocking  call from the group.The group also called Minnesota state representative Carly Melin.Rep. Melin said on Twitter that she recorded the call on her home answering machine.image credit: screen capture Carly Melin via TwitterDuring the 45-second robocall, William Johnson, head of the American Freedom Party, urges voters to support Donald Trump, claiming  the white race is dying out in America and Europe. Minnesota s StarTribune published a transcript of the call, which reads, The American Nationalist Super PAC makes this call to support Donald Trump. I am William Johnson, a farmer and white nationalist. The white race is dying out in America and Europe because we are afraid to be called racist. This is our mind-set: It s OK that our government destroys our children s future, but don t call me racist. I m afraid to be called racist. It s OK to give away our country for immigration, but don t call me racist. It s OK that few schools anymore have beautiful white children in the majority, but don t call me racist. Gradual genocide against the white race is OK, but don t call me racist. I m afraid to be called racist. Donald Trump is not a racist, but Donald Trump is not afraid. Don t vote for a Cuban; vote for Donald Trump.  This call is not authorized by Donald Trump. The group also placed calls to Iowa voters ahead of the state caucus.Iowa resident, David Dwyer, uploaded a recording of the call to Facebook in January.// < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;Signs that it s going to be a long time until the February caucuses in Iowa: I get a robo call from White Nationalists for Trump. Sigh.Posted by David Dwyer on Saturday, January 9, 2016Donald Trump has the white supremacist vote all tied up, much to the dismay of the other Republican candidates.Trump has doubled-down on the party s long history of using dog-whistle politics to appeal to the lowest element of society. Instead of dog-whistles, Trump has brought the Republican party s racist views to the forefront, using a giant bullhorn.The candidate s racist comments about Hispanics, Blacks, Muslims, Asians, along with every other group that white KKKristian society loves to blame for the problems caused by their own party, has rocketed Trump straight to the head of the pack (or Super PAC).It makes sense. After all, conservative voters have been answering the GOP s more-subtle calls, packed with racist innuendo, for a very long time.Right-wing voters are frustrated and angry at mainstream conservatives, whom they see as too concerned with  political correctness,  to come right out and say what they mean.They re sick and tired of their political leaders denying and walking back racist comments. They want Trump s brand of  honesty  and  sincerity.  They want the GOP to openly promote the party s racists views, helping to make their hate seem more  acceptable,  and  mainstream. To hell with the dog-whistles.With Trump they have a leader who will blast their white supremacist views on a bullhorn, and that s exactly what they want.Image credit from Gage Skidmore, via Flickr"
 Ivanka Trump’s Rabbi Decides Not Speak At RNC For A Very Good Reason,"With the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio just days away, presumptive GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump s list of speakers just got shorter. Many Republicans are opting out of attending the event with the exception of an underwear model, Gov. Scott Walker, Ted Cruz, Mike Huckabee, Chris Christie and Ben Carson. And now, Ivanka Trump s Rabbi has decided not to attend.Politico obtained an email from Rabbi Haskel Lookstein to his congregation in which he explained after a backlash that he accepted an invitation from Trump s daughter to deliver the convocation in Cleveland  out of respect for her and our relationship. But that s all changed now and he explained to his congregation why he had a change of heart.Politico reports: Unfortunately, when my name appeared on a list of speakers at the convention, without the context of the invocation I had been invited to present, the whole matter turned from rabbinic to political, something which was never intended,  wrote Lookstein, who also served as the principal of the prominent Orthodox Jewish school Ramaz.But there may be more to it than that   like the backlash that ensued when it was revealed that Lookstein was to speak at the convention.Earlier on Friday, the Jerusalem Post reported that 600 Ramaz alumni had written Lookstein a letter, condemning his decision to speak at the convention.  This is the single action history will remember you by, and history will not be kind,  it read.Lookstein noted in the email the prayer he intended to deliver at the convention, which reads, in part: We thank you for our constitutional government that has created and fostered the American ideals of democracy, freedom, justice and equality for all, regardless of race, religion or national origin. Almighty God: We know that we are living in very dangerous times, when all of these blessings are threatened from without, by forces of terror and unimaginable brutality, and from within, by those who sow the seeds of bigotry, hatred and violence, putting our lives and our way of life at risk. He was seriously going to say that at the divisive GOP candidate s convention. With Ted Cruz, Huckabee and Trump in the room, he was going to speak against bigotry? Wow. That would have gone as well as Ted Nugent speaking at the Democratic Convention. That is, if we even believe the Rabbi s excuse. The letter penned by 600 Ramaz alumni likely had something to do with Lookstein s decision.The Donald is having a very bad day. Tim Tebow released a video in which he strongly denies a story circulated by Trump s presidential campaign that he will be a speaker at the Republican Convention. Many GOP leaders as well as rising stars in the party are opting out of speaking at the event. However, Trump does have his family members penciled in to offer praise for the hotel magnate. And that includes Ivanka   but without her Rabbi.Featured image via John Sommers II/Getty."
 Australia Prime Minister Tells Trump To Man Up And Accept Refugees Because ‘A Deal’s A Deal’,"The  deal-maker  just got owned.Donald Trump embarrassed himself and America again during a recent phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.As we all know, President Obama struck a deal with Australia in 2015 agreeing to take 2,000 refugees from Nauru and Papua New Guinea s Manus Island.But Trump doesn t want to honor the deal, so he whined about it. I hate taking these people,  Trump said.  I guarantee you they are bad. That is why they are in prison right now. They are not going to be wonderful people who go on to work for the local milk people. The refugees are in a detention camp right now because they have been denied entry into Australia. They are not necessarily  bad  people.Trump s  milk people  remark is a reference to the American dairy industry.It s a racist remark, of course. Because not all immigrants perform farm work. Some become doctors and businessmen. Some become teachers and police officers. Some even go into politics.The fact is that United States can also hold these refugees until a thorough vetting process is complete before allowing them to resettle. Therefore, Trump s concern that these refugees are  bad  is ridiculous.Anyway, Turnbull, who is also a businessman, told Trump to suck it up and honor the terms of the agreement. There is nothing more important in business or politics than a deal is a deal,  Turnbull reminded Trump.  You can certainly say that it was not a deal that you would have done, but you are going to stick with it. In other words, the man who allegedly wrote  The Art of The Deal  just got schooled on deal-making by Australia s prime minister.Turnbull is right. A deal is a deal and Trump must comply with it or risk angering and alienating one of our closest allies.Trump cannot just go back and examine every deal made in American history and go back on it if he doesn t agree with it. That s not how governing works. Sitting presidents must honor the agreements made by their predecessors. Anything else violates trust between nations and hurts our reputation around the globe.He can try to renegotiate a deal if he wishes and some deals can even be voided by Congress. But the deal with Australia will be hard to renegotiate because Turnbull expects America to honor it.And we should. It s the right thing to do.Featured Image: Mark Wilson/Getty Images"

 NC Governor Robs Disaster Relief Fund To Hire Lawyers To Defend Trans Bathroom Bill,"Can you put a price on bigotry? North Carolina Republicans just did. It s $500,000.North Carolina is a state precariously placed in the danger zones of both hurricanes and tornadoes. It s suffered its fair share of disastrous floods. It s warm enough to be a fertile ground for the mosquitoes experts warn could be spreading the devastating Zika virus. So it s more than just a little crazy that Republican Governor Pat McCrory announced that he would be robbing his state s own disaster relief fund to pay for the defense of his illegal trans bathroom bill.Led by McCrory, state Republicans have diverted half a million dollars from the state s  Emergency Response and Disaster Relief  fund and say they will use it to hire lawyers to fight tooth-and-nail against the federal government which has deemed the anti-trans bill known as HB2 unconstitutional. Considering how obvious it is that this violates the Civil Rights Act, the money will serve only to delay the inevitable for as long as possible.The law has already cost the state tens of millions of dollars in lost business, boycotts, and bad press. Adding the $500,000 is only going to make things worse. This is particularly dire because the fight against the Zika virus continues to go unfunded at the federal level. A recent bill proposed by Republicans to give some of the funds was shot down by Democrats after they insisted on including an amendment to defund Obamacare. The premise, to take away millions of Americans health insurance during the outbreak of a potential health epidemic was, to put it lightly, repugnant on every level.So rather than get serious at a state level, North Carolina decided to defund itself. It will now head into the eye of the Zika storm with a pitiable amount of money to combat it. Instead, they will pay for a few lawyers to ensure trans people are victimized for just a few months longer. If that doesn t say it all, I don t know what does.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images"
FLASHBACK 2015: ANTI-GUN OBSESSED White House Gives Tips On How To Talk About “Gun Control” At Thanksgiving [VIDEO],"Nothing says  Thanksgiving  or  family  like a room full of brain washed liberals sitting around the dinner table talking about ways to strip Americans of their Constitutional rights This Thanksgiving, the Obama administration wants Americans to talk about why Congress won t pass more gun control   but not about Obama s foreign policy failures.During the White House press briefing, Press Secretary Josh Earnest continued to press a narrative set up by gun control activists in response to the terrorist attacks in Paris. As people sitting around the Thanksgiving table talking about these issues as they should and I m sure they will all across the country, I hope that s a question that will be raised and asked by members around the table,  Earnest said, referring to a bill supported by Democrat to ban people on the no-fly list from purchasing a gun.Earnest attributed opposition to the bill from Republicans and some Democrats to  fear  of the National Rifle Association.But as Breitbart News gun reporter AWR Hawkins has noted, the campaign is misguided as the no-fly list is imprecise. A law based on that list could would block innocent individuals from exercising their Second Amendment right to purchase firearms.Via: Breitbart NewsAnd for those who choose to take the pro-American side of the Second Amendment argument, here s a little video you might want to share with your guests:"
"TREASON? White House Says It’s “Entirely likely,” “Even expected” Iran Will Use $Billions In Sanctions Relief For Terrorism [VIDEO]","So can anyone please explain what the U.S. got in return for Obama s brilliant  nuclear deal? White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Thursday it was  entirely likely  and  even expected  that Iran will continue to support terrorism as it receives tens of billions of dollars in sanctions relief through the Iran nuclear deal.The deal brokered by the Obama administration and other world powers gives Iran, the world s largest state sponsor of terrorism, $100 billion in sanctions relief in exchange for compliance with the agreement meant to stop the rogue regime from getting nuclear weapons.After Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged Thursday that  some  Iran deal money would go to terrorists, CBS reporter Margaret Brennan asked Earnest at the White House briefing whether he agreed. I think that reflects his rather logical conclusion that a nation that supports terrorism may use some of the money that s coming into the country to further support terrorism,  Earnest said.  The thing that s important for people to recognize is that critics of this agreement often exaggerate the value of the sanctions relief that Iran will obtain, and they often overlook the rather severe economic priorities that are badly underfunded inside of Iran. Earnest said the White House had been honest about acknowledging that the nuclear deal would not assuage their concerns about Iran s  bad behavior. It is entirely likely, I think it s even expected, that Iran will continue to support terrorism, but because of Iran s intention that we assess to continue to support terrorism, that s what makes it so important that we prevent them from obtaining a nuclear weapon,  Earnest said. To be clear, what you re saying is while, some may conclude, and it would be logical to conclude, that some monies may flow to groups labeled terrorists, you think you can mitigate the threat, but you do say it could flow there,  Brennan said.

 Bill O’Reilly DESTROYS Donald Trump In A Rant That Shakes Fox News (VIDEO),"In growing signs that rumors of a Fox News split on GOP frontrunner Donald Trump are true, Bill O Reilly is the latest Fox News heavyweight to take a swing at the Trump Campaign. The O Reilly Factor host described the behavior of Donald Trump as  not presidential,  and called on the campaign to  stop the nonsense. O Reilly starts with Trump s response to losing to Ted Cruz in Wisconsin, which for those who missed it, was to issue an aggressive statement denouncing  Lyin Ted : Last night after losing Wisconsin, Trump issued a statement calling Ted Cruz names. Not Presidential. Not a smart move.Seems the Trump campaign is confused.We were hoping the candidate would appear on the Factor this evening, we negotiated with his team for days. But he declined.That of course, is his prerogative. Apparently there is angst in the Trump campaign because Charles Krauthammer sometimes hammers Trump on the Factor. So that s what has driven the Trump Campaign into a frenzy. Like any playground battle amongst toddlers, it is all about who is hanging out with whom. O Reilly is known to have Pulitzer prize-winning columnist Charles Krauthammer on his show fairly frequently, but Krauthammer hates Donald trump, which means the Trump campaign hates Charles Krauthammer and everyone is now throwing sand in each other s faces.And just to reassure you: if this all sounds like the sort of immature behavior that is demeaning to the office for which Donald Trump is running, you re right   it is. But this is the gutter into which the Republican party has dragged itself in recent years, and where it may well die in its own juices.In a week where Greg Gutfeld and Megyn Kelly gave powerful denunciations of Donald Trump and their colleagues who soft pedal interviews and debates with him, O Reilly stepped up with some home truths of his own. The veteran host made it absolutely clear that his team would not be intimidated by the schoolyard bully tactics of the Trump campaign, drawing a clear line in the sand. We have been very fair very fair to Donald Trump on this program, but that does not mean we ll not criticize him or cancel guests who have a dim view of him. O Reilly goes on to demand the Trump campaign  stop the nonsense  and learn to answer fair questions directly, because it will be the only way he gain the support to win. His current level of support  not nearly enough to secure him the White House. Ouch. It seems the Trump campaign is busy alienating every friend it ever made, by demanding an exclusivity of pro-Trump content  or else. Donald Trump was clearly watching the show, as he took to Twitter immediately to refute O Reilly with a one-liner   totally proving O Reilly s point.I was not scheduled to be on the @oreillyfactor. Pure fiction!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 7, 2016This could spell the beginning of the end for Donald Trump, the trust fund tycoon who has no place in the Oval Office.Featured image via screengrab"
" Trump Lashes Out At Puerto Ricans, Calls Them ‘Ingrates’ In Self-Congratulatory Tweets","Again, these are AMERICAN citizens he is talking about.If Donald Trump had treated Texas and Florida the way he is treating Puerto Rico right now, there would be riots in the streets and massive protests in front of the White House.But apparently, people don t seem to understand that the people of Puerto Rico are American citizens who should be given the same respect and treatment that Texans and Floridians received after hurricanes slammed their states.Trump has not done that so far. Not only was he too slow in responding because he focused more on trying to force NFL players to stand during the national anthem, he has not sent nearly enough troops or equipment or supplies to Puerto Rico. And he is insulting them to add insult to injury.Trump has taken to Twitter to constantly brag about the recovery operation despite his response being worse than President George W. Bush s response to Hurricane Katrina. Puerto Rico was devastated by two Category 5 hurricanes, yet less water and food has been sent to the island.When Trump s administration tried to frame the disaster as a  good news story,  San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz fired back by pointing out that people are dying. Trump threw a temper tantrum in response and suggested that Puerto Ricans are lazy people who won t help themselves.On Sunday morning, Trump lashed out again. While bragging about the recovery effort as if it s the best recovery effort in history, Trump congratulated himself and called Puerto Ricans who criticize the weak effort  ingrates. We have done a great job with the almost impossible situation in Puerto Rico. Outside of the Fake News or politically motivated ingrates,  Donald J.

Furthermore, Trump insulted Puerto Ricans again. While Mayor Cruz is working to save lives, Trump is busy golfing and rage-tweeting. He is enraged because he thinks brown people should be grateful for what little help he has provided. That s a totally unacceptable way to treat American citizens.

This is embarrassing Bill, come and get your wife!HOW DARE SHE SAY THIS!Two-time failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton questioned the legitimacy of the 2016 election in a new interview with Mother Jones. I think that there are lots of questions about its legitimacy,  Clinton said.  And we don t have a method for contesting that in our system. VOTER SUPPRESSION? NOW THAT S FUNNY!Clinton listed Russian interference and voter suppression as reasons why she is questioning the legitimacy of President Donald Trump s victory and calling for an independent commission to investigate the matter.WHAT HAPPENED That s why I ve long advocated for an independent commission to get to the bottom of what happened,  she said.SHE WAS FOR IT BEFORE SHE WAS AGAINST ITDuring the 2016 presidential debates, Clinton often derided then-candidate Trump for his comments about the election being rigged and possibly not accepting the results. In the first debate, Clinton said that she supported democracy and would accept the results of the election. I support our democracy. And sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. But I certainly will support the outcome of this election,  Clinton said.Clinton even argued that Trump refusing to say he would accept the results of the election was a threat to American democracy.READ MORE: WFB"
 Trump Just Got Caught Trying To Blackmail Morning Joe Hosts,"Blackmail is a crime. It s time to impeach Donald Trump.Despite a desperate effort by the White House to deny it, Trump derailed those efforts by posting on Twitter Friday morning.In response to a Washington Post story in which Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski claim that Trump tried to blackmail them in order to force them to apologize by promising to stop a National Enquirer tabloid story about the pair if they complied with his demands, Trump went on Twitter and confirmed the whole thing.Watched low rated @Morning_Joe for first time in long time. FAKE NEWS. He called me to stop a National Enquirer article. I said no! Bad show  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 30, 2017The problem for Trump is that while he claims Scarborough called him and he s the one who said no, Scarborough has actual evidence to support his side of the story and he informed Trump of that on Twitter while calling him out for lying at the same time.Yet another lie. I have texts from your top aides and phone records. Also, those records show I haven t spoken with you in many months. https://t.co/TZWiElo6Gs  Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) June 30, 2017Why do you keep lying about things that are so easily disproven? What is wrong with you? https://t.co/aAoUj5HYZS  Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) June 30, 2017So Trump not only lied again, he literally tried to use blackmail against members of the media. It s all the more credible since the owner of the National Enquirer is David Pecker, a longtime friend of Trump s.If anyone should be apologizing to someone, it s Trump. What he said about Brzezinski on Thursday was totally deplorable and completely beneath the dignity of the office he holds.As you recall, Trump attacked the Morning Joe hosts for criticizing him earlier in the week by claiming that Mika was  bleeding badly from a face-lift  and that she is  crazy. I heard poorly rated @Morning_Joe speaks badly of me (don t watch anymore). Then how come low I.Q. Crazy Mika, along with Psycho Joe, came..  Donald J.

Instead, he lashed out because he has thin skin and a vulnerable ego and made things worse by trying to blackmail them. That s the very definition of abuse of power.This national circus has to be put to an end. Trump s crimes in office far exceed Richard Nixon s during Watergate.

" Marco Rubio Really Wants To Win Reelection, But Won’t Rule Out Puling A Sarah Palin (VIDEO)","Marco Rubio hates his job. Last year, he said he wasn t going to run for reelection because he was  frustrated.  He also had one of the worst attendance records in the Senate. Now, Rubio wants his job back, but, as if his voters haven t been screwed enough from him, he won t promise he ll finish his term out.In an interview Tuesday, CNN s Manu Raju asked Rubio if he would commit to serving the entirety of his term, to which the Florida Republican said: No one can make that commitment because you don t know what the future s gonna hold in your life   personally or politically. I can commit to you this,  Rubio said.  That if I am running to be a U.S. Senator, I am fully prepared to allow the U.S. Senate to be the last political office I ever hold.

It could help turn the balance of power one way or another and despite Rubio s horrible tenure and his ambivalence toward the office he s trying to hold, Democrats are facing an uphill battle.Right now, two Democrats are eyeing the Senate in Florida, former Rep. Alan Grayson and Rep. Patrick Murphy. It s expected that Murphy, the more centrist of the two candidates, will win the nomination, but the election is another story. So far, Rubio is handily winning in most polls. Two show him within the margin of error.This fact is kind of amazing, considering Rubio has the absolute worst attendance record in the Senate.Of course, that might actually play well with his anti-government base, who would seemingly rather elect someone who s just a placeholder and an obstructionist, rather than someone who actually does his job for the people of Florida. This is why this country can t have nice things   literally.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images."
 WATCH: Joy Reid Shuts Down Right-Wing Pastor For Lying In Defense Of Racist Trump,"A pastor shamefully lied in defense of Donald Trump on Saturday and Joy Reid shut him down HARD.During an interview on MSNBC, conservative  Christian  pastor Darrell Scott, who is one of the few black people in America who support the Republican nominee, pretended that Trump is not a racist and denied that Trump had anything to do with the birther movement against President Obama.Trump tried to sell himself to black voters on Friday in front of an audience of white people by telling them they have  nothing to lose  by voting for him. That led Reid to ask,  If Donald Trump makes a speech to black people when there are none around to hear it, did he make a sound? Reid turned to Scott and noted that Trump has made two appeals to black voters in recent days in places where the black population only makes up about 1 percent of the total.  Why is he making those appeals in front of almost exclusively white audiences?  she asked.Scott made excuses for Trump, claiming that it doesn t matter where he speaks because all African-Americans hear him. When pressed on why Trump has not accepted invitations from the NAACP, the Urban League, and the National Association of Black Journalists because he supposedly had better things to do already on his schedule.Reid smiled as Scott called Trump  a cultural phenomenon  who draws rock star crowds. Reid then zinged back that those crowds are devoid of black people.Reid slammed Trump for pushing the false notion that every black person in America is living in poverty and going to failing schools and then asked Scott about Trump s history of housing discrimination, which has been cited by the Justice Department because the Republican nominee refused to rent to black people.Scott claimed that it was just an accusation and denied that Trump discriminated against black people, but the record shows that Trump settled the case with the government because there was a strong case against him, hardly the action of a man who didn t commit such an offense.Reid then asked Scott about Trump s prominent role in the birther movement. Despite multiple video tapes of Trump pushing the birther conspiracy and demanding President Obama s birth certificate, Scott also denied that Trump had anything to do with the movement. Don t tell me you agree with the bitherism, sir,  Reid pleaded.  Don t tell me you agree with that. Scott replied by claiming that Hillary Clinton started the birther movement, a notion that is totally false. And Reid shut Scott down for blatantly lying on her show. That s wrong. Even a pastor cannot make things up on this show,  she cautioned. I respect you as a pastor, but you re not going to come on and make things up. Here s the video via MSNBC.Donald Trump is desperately trying to save his flailing campaign and that s the only reason why he is making feeble attempts to court black voters now. If he really cared about black people he would have been courting them from the beginning. Instead, he has been palling around with white supremacists and encouraging violence against black protesters at his rallies. Scott can t sit there and call himself a man of God while lying through his teeth to defend a bloated racist. It s just not going to fly.Featured image via screenshot"
JUST IN: Benghazi Attack Organizer On Way To U.S. After Being Captured In Libya In President Trump Approved Special Ops Mission,"Remember when Hillary stood in front of the families and the 4 dead bodies of brave Americans and lied about  an awful internet video  being the cause of their deaths:Hillary was caught red-handed lying about the  video  by Rep. Jim Jordon (R-OH) in front of the House Select Committee on Benghazi during her testimony:Will today s capture of a top militant who was instrumental in the Benghazi attack finally solve the puzzle about what happened in Benghazi? Will the lies of Hillary and Barack Obama finally be exposed? American Military News   U.S. Special Operations Forces have captured a top militant who was  instrumental  in the Benghazi attack in Libya in 2012 that killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, an information management officer, and two former Navy SEALs, according to a report by the Associated Press.The Associated Press reported Monday that Special Operations Forces have captured the unidentified militant and are transporting the militant back to the U.S. The officials say U.S. commandos captured the unidentified man in Libya and are transporting him back to the U.S. The officials say the mission was approved by President Donald Trump and done in coordination with Libya s internationally recognized government,  the AP reported, adding that the officials  weren t authorized to speak  and  demanded anonymity. The U.S. Ambassador to Libya, J. Christopher Stevens; U.S. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith; and CIA contractors Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, both former Navy SEALs, were killed in the attacks against the diplomatic compound five years ago."
 Republicans Just Changed The Rules To Force Through Trump’s Controversial Nominees,"Senate Republicans on Wednesday took an extraordinary step to force through two of alleged president Donald Trump s top Cabinet nominees after a boycott from Democrats. Republican lawmakers on the Senate Finance Committee changed the rules so there will no longer be a requirement for Democrats to be present to achieve quorum.Republicans then forced through the controversial picks of Rep. Tom Price for Secretary of Health and Human Services and Steve Mnuchin for Secretary of Treasury.Democrats boycotted for very good reasons:Democrats launched their boycott Tuesday because they felt there were too many unanswered questions about the two nominees  possible ethics violations. They refused to participate in the process if there wouldn t be more time for vetting. When not a single Democrat showed up on Tuesday, the vote could not proceed, because of a rule requiring at least one member from the minority party be present.Every single seat on the Democrats  side of the dais was empty.Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-UT) called the boycott  extraordinary circumstances  and allowed the Republicans in the room vote to suspend the rules of the committee.  They, on their own accord, refused to participate in the exercise,  he said.  They have nobody to blame but themselves. The day before, Hatch said the Democrats were  acting like idiots  for their boycott. He said that as if he has no memory of the obstruction Republicans openly launched against President Obama for 8 years.And Democrats have ample reasons to scrutinize the nominees. There is evidence that both Price and Mnuchin lied to the committee.That swamp is being filled with terrifying creatures:For example, Mnuchin has even acknowledged that his answers were not  true, accurate, and complete,  as was apparent from his need to revise his initial disclosure questionnaire twice because of entities he  inadvertently missed.  He also testified that OneWest Bank never used  robo-signers,  even though it frequently did.And there were already questions about whether he was qualified to serve in the position in the first place. Mnuchin s bank foreclosed on tens of thousands of people while accepting $1 billion in loan forgiveness from the FDIC, and may have even broken the law by backdating documents to rush foreclosures.Price, too, has issues. He was involved in legislation that could have benefited his stock holdings. His tax returns and financial disclosure statements were brought into question ahead of the hearing.In the end, both of Trump s nominees were approved 14 0.Hatch was confronted by reporters who rushed over to the building because of the little notice given to the public about the meeting to suspend the rules. He reportedly chuckled and said,  You were scrambling? Well, you know, that s neither here nor there. Hatch admitted that he has not yet spoken with the committee s top Democrat, Sen. Ron Wyden.  I don t feel a bit sorry for them,  he said.Questions will be left unanswered:Democrats asked that Price offer clarify on  inaccurate and misleading answer to questions about privileged and discounted access to stocks,  and wanted Mnuchin to address  inaccurate and misleading answer to questions about the potentially illegal process known as robo-signing,  among other things. I don t care what they want at this point,  Hatch said.One thing we could agree with Trump on is that the swamp needs to be drained. Of course, we knew he wouldn t keep that promise. Republicans have launched an attack on democracy.Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images."
 Why A Wall Street Investor Endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders,"Asher Edelman inspired the character Gordon Gekko in Oliver Stone s 1987 film, Wall Street, played by Michael Douglas. The infamous stockbroker, who made a fortune buying and selling companies in distress, was recently asked on CNBC s Fast Money, who he would endorse for Bernie Sanders. His answer was surprising, but his reasoning is not: Bernie Sanders, no question,  said Edelman. ,  I think it s quite simple again. If you look at something called  velocity of money  That means how much gets spent and turns around. When you have the top one percent getting money, they spend five-ten percent of what they earn. When you have the lower end of the economy getting money, they spend a hundred, or a hundred and ten percent of what they earn. As you ve had a transfer of wealth to the top, and a transfer of income to the top, you have a shrinking consumer base, basically, and you have a shrinking velocity of money. Edelman argued redistributing wealth, especially at the point we are at now with levels of income and wealth inequalities continually growing, is what is best for the economy. Greed and corruption may allow the wealthiest to gain short term profits, but as the middle class disappears and the working class becomes ever burdened, the economy begins to sputter into stagnation.Senator Bernie Sanders  economic policies aren t radical, socialist, or unrealistic. They are simply what is needed to be implemented to fix a broken, rigged economy. Edelman may be a member of the top one percent, but he is intelligent enough to realize trickle down economics doesn t work, and the Republicans who insist on perpetuating economic policies surrounding that myth continue to damage the United States economy.The rich getting richer don t create jobs, customers do. If there aren t any customers to purchase goods and services, such as a middle and working class who earn enough to have disposable income, the economy will falter.Featured image via Addicting Info archives"
HILLARY EPICALLY BOMBS PRESS CONFERENCE About Weekends Attacks By Saying All The Wrong Things [VIDEO],"Hillary Clinton is known world-wide for saying and doing the most ridiculous things, but her press conference concerning the attacks over the weekend has to be the most ridiculous to date.Any American that truly decides to actually listen to the things she said can see that she has run out of any form of ammo against Trump that she thought she had.Just a few of the things she said that will make you think twice: We need a better Visa System. Lets remember what happened on 9/11. These were not refugees. We need to do everything we can to support law enforcement. We will defeat the evil, twisted ideology of the terrorists.   Take the fight to ISIS everywhere they threaten us. These are just a few in a 12 minute long dialogue that sounds like she is doing her best to literally say the opposite of everything she has ever said before.  Hillary even has the gall to claim that Trump is aiding and abetting terrorists. She must have forgotten that she is the one who takes monetary gifts from places like Iran.In an ironic twist Hillary basically blames Trump for any and all attacks saying that his anti-Muslim rhetoric is the root cause for Muslims to want to attack us. Really Hillary?Clinton has tried to push the refugee program on us even after it was made clear that the  refugees  cannot be vetted properly. She has fully supported Black Lives Matter and continuously disrespects Law Enforcement. Hillary has said more than once that she supports the rights of Muslims in America (Sharia Law). Furthermore she tries to label anyone that protests the radical ideology of Islam as terrorists. Every word she says in the press conference is a direct contradiction of her record:"
 Moms With Transgender Kids Have A BRILLIANT Message For Anti-LGBT Conservatives (VIDEO),"Moms of transgender children have just sent every fearmongering transphobic conservative a message that is going to make them furious. In response to the massive amount of hatred and bigotry that has been thrown at the trans community over the last few months, these amazing mothers have given anti-LGBT bigots a brilliant   and sometimes heartbreaking   look at the people who are on the receiving end of the attacks.The video, entitled  Meet My Child , was created by the Trans United Fund for the many transgender adults and children who have been discriminated against and attacked by politicians in 20 states via initiatives like  bathroom bills  in North Carolina. These lawmakers have made it their personal mission to strip trans people of their basic human rights and have Attempted to advance over 50 pieces of legislation attacking transgender people. These policies are a real danger to transgender people and hurt the most vulnerable, including America s transgender children. Meet My Child features three mothers sharing amazing stories of acceptance and love, as well as the process their families when through when their child expressed that they were transgender. The moms in this video want every anti-trans person to know the full extent and consequences of the bigotry they re promoting, which often ends in violent attacks on transgender people. In one particularly emotional moment, a mother with a trans daughter can hardly hold back tears as she says, She s my heart and I don t want to lose her.  The film also leapt at the opportunity to blast conservatives like former Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz for spewing bigotry that puts these children in harm s way.You can watch the amazing message below: What these mothers have shown is exactly what brilliant parenting looks like. Conservatives claim to be so concerned about babies and family values, but only when families and children fit into their narrow-minded view of what a family unit  should  look like. These moms have done an incredible job showing the world what real love and support looks like, and the GOP could certainly learn a thing or two from them.Featured image via screenshot"
FORMER SECRET SERVICE AGENT EXPLAINS TRUMP: “He’s a Queens guy”….”It’s time for the brawler” [Video],"Former Secret Service agent Dan Bongino has an explanation of the hometown identity of politicians and how it leads to an  insider swamp creature  like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.Bongino defended President Trump and dismissed criticism by former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper who questioned Trump s  fitness  for office following a rally in Phoenix, Arizona. They just don t understand Trump. He s a Queens guy,  Bongino said on  Fox & Friends  Thursday.OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON JAMES CLAPPER TRYING TO SLAM TRUMP S  FITNESS FOR OFFICE : Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper was way out of line and way too political last night when he showed his cards BIGTIME on President Trump. He followed the latest leftist line that Trump  isn t fit to serve Yes, the loony left has a new play book that makes the false claim that somehow Trump is  unfit  to be president.We ve reported on clapper before but his  not wittingly  comment before the Senate is legend. Remember when he was asked if the NSA spies on Americans and he replied  not wittingly ? Yes, well, that was perjury.More recently Clapper bashed President Trump during a discussion on national security and the Trump/Russia fake scandal.It s clear that Clapper is a political pawn who is out to try and make our president look bad. This is serious Deep State stuff.We re sure this isn t the end of James Clapper s involvement in the opposition to President Trump."
 Bill Clinton Reminds People Of Hillary’s LONG History Of Getting Things Done (VIDEO),"If there s one couple that Republicans love to attack, it s the Clintons. For decades, they have been under constant dubious scrutiny, more so than almost any other politician. Why? Because they have an incredible history of getting stuff done. Stuff their critics would rather not see be getting passed, and work they would rather not see being accomplished. If Republicans can successfully make a scandal of the Clintons to try to discredit all their accomplishments, that will help Republicans beat Hillary in 2016. It s political theater at its best and worst.Appearing on the campaign trail for this first time this election cycle in Nashua, New Hampshire, was former President Bill Clinton. If anyone can explain the exemplary work Hillary has done throughout her long career, it s Bill. And while many like to say Hillary changes her support with the wind of any popular idea, or copies other candidates, they clearly don t know the work she s done, and how she often set the precedent for not only knowing how to get the job done, but getting it done. This pattern of accomplishment began long before she even remotely thought about running for any sort of elected office.The former president explained that his wife was a minority as a woman among law students at Yale, and while she really could have done anything with her career, she decided to help children and the poor through her work with the Children s Defense Fund. He said: There she was at Yale Law School. She could have written her ticket to go anywhere she wanted all she was really interested in was providing legal services to poor people  She hadn t been elected to anything, but everything she touched became better. As TIME so perfectly summed up Clinton s remarks: He remembered that Hillary had helped found an early education program for immigrant children in Arkansas and that she has investigated the placement of African-American children in adult prisons in South Carolina.In another anecdote, Bill said that Hillary as First Lady worked on a bill to reform foster care policy in the late 1990s with Tom DeLay, then a leading Republican in the House of Representatives. This is all in addition to her later political work, like in helping get the Iran Deal passed, or her part in capturing and killing Osama bin Laden, or her countless hours mending relationships around the globe, all while keeping her cool under the most brutal fallacious condemnation.Clinton stated: I do not believe in my lifetime, anybody has run for this job at a moment of greater importance who was better qualified by knowledge, experience and temperament to do what needs to be done now. Her experience speaks volumes. Her calm under pressure is unmatched, and her ability to get people to come together to get the tough jobs done can be seen in the work she s accomplished.It s clear Bill is in this to win it for Hillary, and is focusing on what his wife has done instead of attacking opposition.It will be interesting to see what the rest of this fast approaching primary season will offer.

 Seahawks’ Richard Sherman DROPS THE MIC On Those Who Ignore Police Brutality (VIDEO),"There s a lot being said about football players across the NFL standing together in unity against police brutality. This is even more pertinent now, as even more black men have been gunned down in the street just this week by police.Using his press conference to bring further awareness to this topic was none other than Seattle Seahawks  star cornerback Richard Sherman. He said: I m not going to answer any questions today, and it s no offense to you guys, but the state of things in the world today is very interesting. I think you have players that are trying to take a stand and be aware of social issues and try to make a stand and increase people s awareness and put a spotlight on it and they re being ignored. Whether they re taking a knee or whether they re locking arms, you know, they re trying to bring people together and united them for a cause. And I think that the last couple days a couple more guys have gotten shot and killed in the middle of the street and more videos have come out of guys getting killed, and I think people are still missing the point.The reason these guys are kneeling. The reason we re locking arms is to bring people together. To make people aware that this is not right. You know, it s not right for people to get killed in the street. Sherman then explains how he s been proactive in the community and even needing to go so far as to train young people of color on how to behave with the police, but still being fearful that they might get shot. He says,  that s an unfortunate time to be living.  Especially when people are being killed for no reason.He then has some choice words by those who are supposedly offended by those standing up against police brutality by quietly using their First Amendment right of dissent and protest to bring awareness to the plight. Sherman says: When a guy takes a knee, you can ignore it. You can say he s not being patriotic. He s not honoring the flag. I m doing none of those things. I m saying straight up, this is wrong and we need to do something. And something most certainly needs to be done, and done now.Watch Sherman speak here:Wow  this is a must-watch.Seattle Seahawks  Richard Sherman addresses police killings of African American men at presser, then walks out. pic.twitter.com/GOAOSgufAx  Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) September 22, 2016Featured image via video screen capture"
 New Group Of Armed Idiots Show Up To Provide ‘Security’ For Bundy Militia Terrorists (VIDEO),"Just when we thought the situation with the Bundy militia in Oregon couldn t get any worse, it does. The drama is heating up now, because another group of lawless armed militants have decided to come be the  security  for the militia. There s just one problem with that, though: the original militia says they don t want these new folks there.The new group calls themselves the Pacific Patriot Network, and they have taken it upon themselves to send armed guards from their group to  protect  the original occupying militia. However, Todd MacFarlane, who is a lawyer for the Bundy side of the standoff, says of these new people: We don t need that. We don t want it and we re asking you to leave. According to the Bundy group, they really want to keep the situation from getting any worse than it already has. MacFarlane says that the Bundy group is, quote,  alarmed  by the Pacific Patriot Network guards. According the Brandon Curtiss, who heads the Pacific Patriot Network up, the guards he sent will only be  patrolling the perimeter  and has no plans to interfere with original occupants, or even join them in occupation.However, the point is, the Bundys people don t want them there. The new people must be really scary if the original terrorists don t even want anything to do with them. At this point, the federal government needs to simply step in and do something about these people. It really has gotten way out of hand.Watch Bundy s militia people talk about these newbies, below:Featured image via video screen capture from Raw Story"

 Karma’s A B*tch: Judge Orders Anti-Gay Preacher’s Church Up For Public Auction Due To Unpaid Debts,"Pastor James David Manning is one of the most vocally homophobic preachers in America. He is the leader of Atlah Worldwide Church, and has made such disgusting public statements as  Jesus would stone homos,  and tried to accuse gay people of spreading Ebola through Starbucks coffee. Well, Pastor Manning is finally getting his comeuppance, because a judge has ordered that his hateful church be put up for public auction.The reason for the order is that Manning has not been paying his church s bill. DNA Info reports that Manning has nine tax liens against the church s property. The debts include, but are not limited to:Manning, however, is as delusional as ever, and insists that he didn t know about the auctioning of his church until last week. This seems to be a flat-out lie, though, as his lawyers responded to the case as early as October 2009, which is a month after the case was opened. Manning also plans to go against the auction order, which was filed by Judge Joan Kenny on December 17, 2015. Manning says of the auctioning of his church: I assure you, it s about a water bill and a tax that can t be levied against this church. I think it s a land grab quite frankly. Though the church is, like all others, tax exempt, Manning seems to be unable to comprehend that being a tax exempt religious institution does not mean that he does not have to pay his bills. To that end, whatever appeals he might make to stop the auction will likely prove fruitless. The auction will be held on February 24.This is all to the good, as the community can now be effectively free of Manning and his followers  constant and unending stream of homophobic hate speech. Harlem will definitely be a better place.Featured image via screen capture from the Manning Report on YouTube"
 Right-Wing Broadcaster: Teenage Girl Is A ‘Prostitute’ For Being Afraid Of Bundy Militia (VIDEO),"We recently saw the heartbreaking plea of 15-year-old Ashlie Presley, who lives in the area that is currently being occupied by Ammon Bundy and his band of would-be domestic terrorists. She bravely took the microphone and tearfully explained why she was begging the militia to leave. One would think that most people would feel sympathy for her, but no, some people are too callous to feel anything at all. One such person is right-wing broadcast personality Pete Santilli.Presley is the granddaughter of Judge Steven Grasty, and Santilli decided to capitalize on that fact. He said that Grasty had allowed his grandchild to become a  prostitute.  In one of his broadcasts, live from the wildlife refuge where the militants are camped out, Santilli said: That judge was prostituting his granddaughter for political purposes, I m going to call it for what it is. If it were my granddaughter, I would not treat her like a prostitute like he did. He then went on to attack anyone and everyone who opposes what this militia is doing, calling them   bunch of effing communists  for letting the child speak at the meeting. Santilli ranted: What he did with his granddaughter is disgusting. It s called prostitution, okay? Except you gave it up for free  She s a young girl, she did just a masterful dramatic performance. The only reason that anyone needs to be fearful about what s going on around here are the corrupt bastards like her grandfather. He needs to be fearful because we re going to investigate and we re going to bring some justice to a judge. So, it sounds like this guy is not only attacking a vulnerable, scared teenage girl, but he is also threatening a judge. When will these yahoos be arrested?Watch the video of Santilli s vile remarks below:Featured image via screen capture from Raw Story"
 Trump Brags About Hurricane Size As Florida Braces For Disaster,"Donald Trump is apparently thrilled that Hurricane Irma will be the biggest storm to ever hit the United States.Only weeks after Hurricane Harvey left a swath of devastation and death in Texas, Florida is bracing for an even deadlier and more destructive storm.People will die. Businesses and homes will be wiped off the map. Suffering and homelessness will be the reality in Florida. But Trump is too busy bragging about the size of the hurricane to actually care about the people who are in the path of the storm.In yet another Twitter rant on Wednesday morning, Trump proclaimed that his team is already in Florida preparing for the storm after bragging about what a  good job  they have done in Texas.Watching Hurricane closely. My team, which has done, and is doing, such a good job in Texas, is already in Florida. No rest for the weary!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 6, 2017In fact, Trump s response to Hurricane Harvey was to brag about the size of that storm, and he ended an Obama-era flood policy as Houston drowned. Trump has also proposed massive cuts to FEMA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which predicts and tracks hurricanes.It should also be noted that Trump inherited a FEMA that took the lessons of Hurricane Katrina seriously in preparation for future storms. So, Trump and his team did nothing special.But what Trump did next on Twitter shows just how little empathy and compassion he has for the people in the path of Hurricane Irma.Hurricane looks like largest ever recorded in the Atlantic!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 6, 2017Yeah, you read that right. Trump literally bragged about the size of this hurricane as if it s something to be proud of. This coming from a man who denies the very climate change that is causing bigger and more destructive hurricanes to form.As Floridians prepare for disaster, they must be wondering why Trump is so excited about watching them get slammed by the largest hurricane to ever strike the United States. If anything, Trump should be concerned about the coming destruction and death instead of bragging like he s about to win a prize.Featured Image: Jim Lo Scalzo   Pool/Getty Images"
 Superdelegate Tammy Baldwin: ‘I’m Still A Human’ (VIDEO),"The race is heating up as New York heads into their primary this coming Tuesday. Currently, polls have Hillary Clinton ahead by ten to seventeen points. Clinton, who is ahead nationally by more than 200 pledged delegates and hundreds more superdelegates, will need to win her home state to continue momentum after Sanders  string of wins in the previous weeks.A New York win for Clinton will mean more delegates she desperately needs, and with that will come superdelegate support.But the superdelegates have continued to cause controversy within the Democratic primary. Supporters who back Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders have decried the system, feeling the individuals who make up the superdelegate system have been manifestly unfair as to how they allocate their support.Supporters within the Sanders camp have demanded that the superdelegates vote the same way as the pledged   at the will of the voters for that state.But that isn t how the superdelegate system is set up (another word for superdelegates is unpledged delegates).However, that hasn t stopped the demands. And it hasn t stopped the harsh criticism, either. While these delegates have been regarded as  shills,   bought-and-paid-for  and  establishment, one superdelegate wants to remind the nay-sayers of one thing: they are still human.Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Congress  first openly-lesbian senator, is also a superdelegate. And she s pretty fed up with the inquisitions. On MSNBC s Morning Joe, the progressive senator claimed if Sanders clinches the popular vote by the time the convention is held in July, she will cast her vote for him. However, as Clinton continues her popular vote lead, she s supporting the former Secretary of State. She added, nervously: I am a human being and a Superdelegate. To put it plainly, based on how the rules are set up, Baldwin is free to vote her conscience, and her conscience says Hillary Clinton for now. Those who back Senator Sanders point to the fact he beat Clinton by 13 points in Wisconsin, thus Baldwin is somehow obligated to back him.It is important to remember that these superdelegates are party leaders who, in their own right, have been elected within the Democratic Party   whether it be a position within the DNC, or a senatorial, gubernatorial or representative position. It s also important to remember these delegates have nothing but the best of intentions for their party and the future of the country.Baldwin hasn t reported any harassment, but other superdelegates have (one s 12 year old child received the brunt of hrrasment when they answered the phone).Here s Baldwin s appearance on MSNBC:  Featured image via Astrid Riecken/Getty Images"
NO “Dead broke” LESBIANS ALLOWED…,"Hillary heads to DC for an exclusive fundraiser hosted by  one-percenter lesbians Hillary Clinton will be in Washington, D.C., on Monday night for a fundraiser hosted by and attended by predominantly lesbian supporters.About 120 people are expected to attend the event, which is being billed as  an intimate fundraiser  at the Woman s National Democratic Club. The cost to attend is $2,700 per person. For the more generous, those willing to bundle $27,000 ahead of the event also get to attend a special reception with Clinton.The event is being hosted by Claire Lucas and her partner, Judy Dlugacz, who founded a travel company called Olivia, which sells cruises targeting the lesbian community. Lucas told The Huffington Post that she and Dlugacz decided a couple of weeks ago that they wanted to do something to support Clinton s presidential run, so they started reaching out to their network of contacts to gauge interest. The result is Monday s event, which Lucas estimates will be about 75 percent lesbian attendees from around the country. That s atypical for an LGBT political fundraiser, which are by and large organized and attended by gay men. We had such a big group of people wanting to attend,  said Lucas, who acknowledged it is  unusual  that the event will have such a strong lesbian presence.The Clinton event lands just as President Barack Obama has declared June as LGBT Pride Month, something he has done for several years. There are two other Pride-related fundraising events for Clinton s campaign in D.C. this week, though she is not expected to attend them.The first, on June 10, is being hosted by gay Democratic activist Lane Hudson at the Howard Theater. The second one, on June 11, is being hosted by LGBT supporters at Lost Society. That event will include appearances by Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), the first openly lesbian U.S. senator, and four other openly gay members of Congress: Reps. Jared Polis (D-Colo.), David Cicilline (D-R.I.), Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.) and Mark Takano (D-Calif.).Clinton is a vocal supporter of LGBT rights and featured a gay couple in the campaign kick-off video she used in April to announce her presidential run. That couple later invited Clinton to their wedding.Via: Huffington Post"

 Seth MacFarlane Just Told Johnson And Stein Supporters EXACTLY What They Need To Hear (TWEET),"In a perfect democracy, there would be multiple viable parties to choose candidates from. Each one would have to work hard and strive for our vote, and each one would have an equal chance at winning. Unfortunately, because of the way election laws and funding are currently in the United States, we re pretty much stuck with a two-party system and any third-party vote goes to help one of the two major parties.Think Ralph Nader in 2000 and how his votes in Florida gave us George W. Bush. Well, Nader and the Supreme Court.It s imperfect, but until laws are changed, it is what it is. No amount of whining or sitting elections out is going to change that. What we need are legislators willing to change the laws, but that s never going to happen if people keep having hissy fits.This year s election is so critical not just for the nation, but the entire world. A Donald Trump presidency would be catastrophic on so many levels, both with domestic and foreign policy.Reminding everyone how important this election is, and how a third-party vote will give us a President Trump, is none other than the legendary writer/producer and creator of Family Guy, Seth MacFarlane.MacFarlane tweeted: Remember: This November you can help elect President Donald Trump just by voting for Gary Johnson or Jill Stein! Happy Election Year! Remember: This November you can help elect President Donald Trump just by voting for Gary Johnson or Jill Stein! Happy Election Year!  Seth MacFarlane (@SethMacFarlane) September 19, 2016His sarcasm is more a terrifying wake-up call than just witty banter on the Twitter machine.Does this mean you shouldn t vote for Stein or Johnson? No, of course not. However, it needs to be brought to people s attention that their vote for a third party isn t actually going to put their candidate into office, but rather have the possibility of ushering in the apocalypse with Trump.A  conscience vote  does not do anyone any good with a Fascist in the White House, and it goes much deeper than just feeling good about yourself on election day.So, do what you do. That s your freedom to do so, but remember the unintended consequences of that vote and what will be in store for the entire world.Featured Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images"
WATCH OUT RINOS AND DEMOCRATS! The 7 Senate Seats Most Likely to Flip,"We can t wait for next year s midterm elections! This will be a huge chance for Republicans to build a bigger majority in the Senate.The Senate map heavily favors Republicans who look solid except for a couple seats. Democrats don t have it so good. They ll have to defend 25 seats!Here are the seven most vulnerable Senate seats according to The Hill:Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) Heller is the only Republican up for reelection in 2018 who represents a state that Hillary Clinton won last November. Making matters worse for Heller, he s had a rough 2017.Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) McCaskill is one of the few statewide Democratic officeholders left in Missouri, which Trump won by 19 points in November.Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) Donnelly leveraged a bipartisan approach to politics and his blue-collar appeal into a Senate seat in 2012, but he ll have to fight yet another tough battle if he wants to keep his Senate seat in a state Trump won by 19 points.Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) Flake wouldn t rank this high in a normal election year, but a Republican president threatening to support a primary challenge to an incumbent GOP senator isn t normal, either.Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) In 2016, West Virginia went for Trump by a larger margin than any other state   42 points.Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) Heitkamp hails from another deep-red state   North Dakota went for Trump by about 36 points.Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) Republicans have a lot to like about their Montana prospects. Trump won the state by more than 20 points in November, and Republican Greg Gianforte just won the state s at-large congressional seat in a special election   even after he assaulted a reporter."

" Desperate Staff Sent Melania To Stop 2-Hour Trump/Putin Meeting, She Failed","If you ever needed evidence of Donald Trump s bromance with Vladimir Putin, it s in the amount of time they spent together. Though their private meeting at the G-20 summit was supposed to last a half hour, Trump ended up spending two hours and sixteen minutes with the man who helped him get elected through a fierce and well-funded propaganda campaign as well as an extensive hacking effort. Several times I had to remind the president, people were sticking their heads in the door,  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told the Washington Examiner.  They even sent in the first lady at one point to see if she could get us out of there, and that didn t work either. We went another hour after she came in to see us, so clearly, she failed. There was so much to talk about,  said Tillerson.  Neither one of them wanted to stop. Tillerson says that Trump and Putin got along like they had been best friends all their lives. The two leaders connected very quickly,  he says.  There was a very clear positive chemistry. Don t worry, though. Trump is on top of this Russia scandal thing. He asked Vlad if Russia interfered with our election and accepted at face value that Putin absolutely did not help him win.  Nothing to see here:Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who attended the meeting along with Tillerson, said Trump accepted Putin s assurances that Russia didn t meddle in the U.S. election. But Tillerson said the Russians had asked for  proof and evidence  of its involvement. A day earlier, Trump had said Russia probably meddled but that other countries likely did, too.Tillerson said the two leaders had agreed to continue the discussion, with an eye toward securing a commitment that Russia won t interfere in U.S. affairs in the future.See? Case closed. Nothing to worry about. Everything is perfectly normal.Featured image via Twitter"
[VIDEO] SHOCKING CONSEQUENCES OF OPEN IMMIGRATION: Christians Organize To Fight Back Against Islamization Of Britain,"This video shows what happens when a large population of muslim immigrants refuse to assimilate with the culture of residents living in the country where they have immigrated. Instead, muslims in Britain and in countries all over the world are demanding the citizens who have been living there for centuries conform to their extreme radical religious views. In May, new census data published by the British government showed that Islam is set to become the dominant religion in Britain within the next generation.On being informed that the girl did not want to get married, Mohammed Shahid Akhtar, Imam of Birmingham s Central Jamia Masjid Ghamkol Sharif Mosque, said,  She s 14. By Sharia, grace of Allah, she s legal to get married. The Muslim population of Britain topped 3.3 million by the end of 2013 to become around 5.2% of the overall population of 63 million, according to figures extrapolated from a recent study on the growth of the Muslim population in Europe.At the same time, opinion surveys consistently show that voters in Britain view Islam and the question of Muslim immigration as a top-ranked public concern. The British public, it seems, is increasingly worried about the establishment of a parallel Muslim society there.But government efforts to push back against the Islamization of Britain have been halting and half-hearted.What follows is a chronological review of some of the main stories involving the rise of Islam in Britain during 2013.In January, Muslim gangs were filmed loitering on streets in London and demanding that passersby conform to Islamic Sharia law. In a series of videos, the self-proclaimed vigilantes who call themselves Muslim London Patrol are seen abusing non-Muslim pedestrians and repeatedly shouting  this is a Muslim area. One video records the men shouting:  Allah is the greatest! Islam is here, whether you like it or not. We are here! We are here! What we need is Islam! What we need is Sharia! The video continues:  We are the Muslim Patrol. We are in north London, we are in south London, in east London and west London. We command good and forbid evil. Islam is here in London. [Prime Minister] David Cameron, Mr. Police Officer, whether you like it or not, we will command good and forbid evil. You will never get us. You can go to hell! This is not a Christian country. To hell with Christianity. Isa [Jesus] was a messenger of Allah. Muslim Patrol will never die. Allah is great! Allah is great! We are coming! In a January 23 interview with the online newspaper International Business Times, Anjem Choudary, a radical preacher who has long called for Sharia law to be implemented in Britain and other European countries, defended the gang, saying:  This is a wake-up call for society to ask,  where are we headed?  There is a clash between Islam and liberal democracy in hotspot areas of London. Choudary has previously led a campaign, known as the Islamic Emirates Project, to turn twelve British cities including what he calls  Londonistan into independent Islamic states. The so-called Islamic Emirates would function as autonomous enclaves, ruled by Sharia law and governed entirely outside British jurisprudence.In February, Choudary was filmed urging his followers to quit their jobs and claim unemployment benefits so they have more time to plan holy war against non-Muslims.Excerpts of the speech, published by the London-based newspaper The Sun on February 17, drew renewed attention to the growing problem of Muslims in Britain and elsewhere who are exploiting European welfare systems.In the video, Choudary is recorded as saying that Muslims are justified in taking money from non-Muslims, whom he mocks for working in nine-to-five jobs their whole lives. He says:  You find people are busy working the whole of their life. They wake up at 7 o clock. They go to work at 9 o clock. They work for eight, nine hours a day. They come home at 7 o clock, watch EastEnders [a British soap opera], sleep, and they do that for 40 years of their life. That is called slavery. . . . What kind of life is that? That is the life of the kuffar [a non-Muslim]. Choudary urges fellow Muslims to learn from revered figures in Islamic history who only worked one or two days a year.  The rest of the year they were busy with jihad [holy war] and things like that,  he says.  People will say,  Ah, but you are not working.  But the normal situation is for you to take money from the kuffar. So we take Jihad Seeker s Allowance. In March, the London-based newspaper The Independent reported that at least 100 British Muslims are currently active as jihadists fighting in Syria, which has replaced Afghanistan, Pakistan and Somalia as the main destination for militant Islamists seeking to obtain immediate combat experience with little or no official scrutiny.Also in March, St. John s Episcopal Church in Aberdeen, Scotland, became the first church in the United Kingdom to share its premises with Muslim worshippers. Church officials now welcome hundreds of Muslims praying five times a day in their building because the nearby mosque is filled to overcapacity and Muslim worshippers are forced to pray outside.

STEPHEN MOORE: What Republican Turncoats Forget…Examining The Case Of The Republicans For Hillary,"Stephen Moore has been a regular contributor to FOX News and is now a Trump campaign economic adviser. He recently debated the most liberal hack economist on the planet and kicked his a$$:WATCH LYING LIBERAL ECONOMIST Get Hammered By TRUMP S Economic Advisor [Video]He questions the  Republican turncoats  on what they re doing to the conservative movement by not supporting Trump:I asked a successful businessman the other day what he thought about Donald Trump. He turned his thumb down. Wow. Are you going to vote for Hillary? I asked with trepidation.  Of course not,  he replied almost insulted by the question.  I understand the concept of a binary decision.  I got a similar response when I asked oil magnate T. Boone Pickens whether he would vote for Mr. Trump. He looked at me with a quizzical look on his face and replied:  Well, who else is there to vote for?  Right. Who else is there? Yet amazingly a caucus of lifelong Republican politicos in Washington are announcing to the world with defiance and self-righteousness that they will vote for Hillary Clinton. They are mostly former Romney and Bush operatives. They lost and now they want people to believe that their anti-Trumpism is an act of heroism and principle. They ingratiate themselves to The New York Times, The Washington Post and Team Clinton   the sworn enemies of free markets and conservative values. Somehow this doesn t offend their moral compass. I certainly don t mean to disparage conservatives who say they won t vote for Mr. Trump. One s vote is a matter of personal conscience. But to actively support Hillary is to put the other team s jersey on and then run a lap around the stadium. It s worth, because none of the arguments make much sense. First, many say that Trump can t win   it s hopeless. These are the same political geniuses who a year ago assured us that Mr. Trump could never win a primary (he won most of them), then that he couldn t win 50 percent of the vote (he did), then that he couldn t win 50 percent outside of New York (he did), then they said he couldn t win a majority of the delegates (he did)   On every occasion the Trump haters were wrong. How about a little humility since they are batting 0.00. The  Trump can t win  mantra isn t just wrong, it s subversive. Of course, he can win. He is running against Hillary Clinton for goodness sakes. So why do they say this? Because the never Trumpers want Trump to lose because he is to the political class (Republicans and Democrats) the disruptor that Uber is to taxicab drivers. Second is the complaint by some economists that Mr. Trump can t be supported because he is not for free trade. Longtime Washington insider Vin Weber reportedly recently said:  The world economic order and the Republican Party  would be  all in shambles  if Mr. Trump wins.  I think markets would collapse.  Really? Hillary Clinton flip flops every day on free trade, so why is it that only Mr. Trump would cause a recession? He doesn t get that the Trump movement is a revolt against the world order. Mr. Trump is calling for the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan. He is for regulatory relief and school choice. Mr. Trump wants to kill Obamacare. Mr. Trump wants a pro-America drilling policy on energy. Hillary wants to soak the rich, increase the debt, stop energy development, expand entitlements and double down on Obamacare. How is this a difficult choice for a free marketeer? Third, the Trump haters say we must throw Mr. Trump over the bus in order to save the Senate and House majorities. This is a foolhardy strategy because one can t win without the other. As economist Donald Luskin puts it in his historical analysis of presidential races and Senate gains:  It is clear from history that the House and the Senate always move in the same party direction as the White House, and with the same magnitude. That means the presidential candidate is like a boat that congressional candidates are riding on. It s really stupid to torpedo that boat.   Finally, there is the view expressed by Bret Stephens, my former colleague at The Wall Street Journal, who wants to  make sure Trump is the biggest loser in presidential history  so that we can  rebuild the conservative movement.  Bret, if Obama/Hillary win a third straight presidential race, there won t be a conservative movement left to rebuild. The Republicans will move to the left. Worse, for President Obama to win effectively a third term will be a voter validation of all of the destructive policies of the last eight years. Do the  never Trumpers  want to facilitate that? Do they want to hand the left its greatest victory for liberal governance of all time? If they do, they, not Trump, are the unforgivable betrayers of conservative principles.

Tyranny Of 9/11: The Building Blocks Of The American Police State From A-Z," No one man can terrorize a whole nation unless we are all his accomplices.    Edward R. MurrowJohn W. Whitehead Huffington PostWe ve walked a strange and harrowing road since September 11, 2001, littered with the debris of our once-vaunted liberties.Over the past 15 years, we have gone from a nation that took great pride in being a model of a representative democracy to being a model of how to persuade the citizenry to march in lockstep with a police state.What began with the passage of the USA Patriot Act in October 2001 has snowballed into the eradication of every vital safeguard against government overreach, corruption and abuse.This is not freedom. This is a jail cell. Set against a backdrop of government surveillance, militarized police, SWAT team raids, asset forfeiture, eminent domain, overcriminalization, armed surveillance drones, whole body scanners, stop and frisk searches, roving VIPR raids and the like all of which have been sanctioned by Congress, the White House and the courts our constitutional freedoms have been steadily chipped away at, undermined, eroded, whittled down, and generally discarded.Our losses are mounting with every passing day.Free speech, the right to protest, the right to challenge government wrongdoing, due process, a presumption of innocence, the right to self-defense, accountability and transparency in government, privacy, press, sovereignty, assembly, bodily integrity, representative government: all of these and more have become casualties in the government s war on the American people, a war that has grown more pronounced since 9/11.Since the towers fell on 9/11, the American people have been treated like enemy combatants, to be spied on, tracked, scanned, frisked, searched, subjected to all manner of intrusions, intimidated, invaded, raided, manhandled, censored, silenced, shot at, locked up, and denied due process.In allowing ourselves to be distracted by terror drills, foreign wars, color-coded warnings, underwear bombers and other carefully constructed exercises in propaganda, sleight of hand, and obfuscation, we failed to recognize that the true enemy to freedom was lurking among us all the while.Indeed, the U.S. government now poses a greater threat to our freedoms than any terrorist, extremist or foreign entity ever could. Here s an A-to-Z primer to spell out exactly what government tyranny means post 9/11.A is for the AMERICAN POLICE STATE.B is for our battered BILL OF RIGHTS.C is for CIVIL ASSET FORFEITURE, a diabolical governmental scheme to deprive Americans of their liberties, namely, the right to property.D is for DRONES, weaponized, equipped with lasers, tasers and scanning devices, and aimed at  we the people. E is for ELECTRONIC CONCENTRATION CAMP in which all citizens are suspects, their activities monitored and regulated, their movements tracked, their communications spied upon, and their lives, liberties and pursuit of happiness dependent on the government s say-so.F is for FUSION CENTERS, which serve as a clearinghouse for information shared between state, local and federal agencies. These fusion centers can constantly monitor our communications, everything from our internet activity and web searches to text messages, phone calls and emails.G is for GRENADE LAUNCHERS and GLOBAL POLICE. Take small-town police forces, equip them with enough firepower to render any citizen resistance futile, and then enlist them to be part of the United Nations  Strong Cities Network program, and you not only have a standing army that can operate beyond the reach of the Constitution, but one that is part of a global police force.H is for HOLLOW-POINT BULLETS. The government s efforts to militarize and weaponize its agencies and employees is reaching epic proportions, with federal agencies as varied as the Department of Homeland Security and the Social Security Administration stockpiling millions of lethal hollow-point bullets.I is for the INTERNET OF THINGS. This  connected  industry propels us closer to a future where police agencies apprehend virtually anyone if the government  thinks  they may commit a crime, driverless cars populate the highways, and a person s biometrics are constantly scanned and used to track their movements, target them for advertising, and keep them under perpetual surveillance.J is for JAILING FOR PROFIT. Having outsourced their inmate population to private prisons run by private corporations, this profit-driven form of mass punishment has given rise to a $70 billion private prison industry that relies on the complicity of state governments to keep their privately run prisons full by jailing large numbers of Americans for inane crimes.K is for KENTUCKY V. KING, a ruling that opens the door to warrantless police raids, leaving Americans with little real protection in the face of all manner of abuses by law enforcement officials.L is for LICENSE PLATE READERS, which enable law enforcement to track the whereabouts of vehicles, and their occupants, all across the country.M is for MAIN CORE, the U.S. government s database of 8 million or more names and information on Americans considered  threats  to the nation who should be rounded up in times of national emergency or under martial law.N is for NO-KNOCK RAIDS. More than 80,000 of these paramilitary raids are carried out every year more than 200 SWAT team raids every day and all in the pursuit of someone merely suspected of a crime, usually possession of some small amount of drugs.O is for OVERCRIMINALIZATION, which has resulted in an uptick in Americans being arrested and jailed for such absurd  violations  as letting their kids play at a park unsupervised, collecting rainwater and snow runoff on their own property, growing vegetables in their yard, and holding Bible studies in their living room.P is for PATHOCRACY and PRECRIME, tyranny at the hands of a psychopathic government. Couple that with the government s burgeoning precrime programs, and anyone seen as opposing the government whether they re Left, Right or somewhere in between becomes a potential extremist.Q is for QUALIFIED IMMUNITY, which allows officers to walk away without paying a dime for their wrongdoing.R is for ROADSIDE STRIP SEARCHES and BLOOD DRAWS. The courts have increasingly erred on the side of giving government officials especially the police vast discretion in carrying out strip searches, blood draws and even anal probes for a broad range of violations, no matter how minor the offense.S is for the SURVEILLANCE STATE. On any given day, the average American going about his daily business will be monitored, surveilled, spied on and tracked in more than 20 different ways, by both government and corporate eyes and ears.T is for TASERS and other nonlethal weapons, which enable police to aggress with the push of a button, making the potential for overblown confrontations over minor incidents that much more likely.U is for UNARMED CITIZENS SHOT BY POLICE. No longer is it unusual to hear about incidents in which police shoot unarmed individuals first and ask questions later, often attributed to a fear for their safety.V is for VIPR SQUADS, which are tasked with carrying out so-called  soft target  security inspections whenever and wherever the government deems appropriate, at random times and places, and without needing the justification of a particular threat.W is for WHOLE-BODY SCANNERS. Using either x-ray radiation or radio waves,scanning devices and government mobile units are being used not only to  see  through your clothes but to spy on you within the privacy of your home.X is for X-KEYSCORE. One of the many spying programs carried out by the NSA that targets every person in the United States who uses a computer or phone.Y is for YOU-NESS. Facial recognition software promises to create a society in which you can be tracked based on your face, mannerisms, social media and  you-ness. Z is for ZERO TOLERANCE, in which young people are increasingly viewed as suspects and treated as criminals by school officials and law enforcement alike, often for engaging in little more than childish behavior. The lesson being taught to our youngest and most impressionable citizens is this: in the American police state, you re either a prisoner (shackled, controlled, monitored, ordered about, limited in what you can do and say, your life not your own) or a prison bureaucrat (politician, police officer, judge, jailer, spy, profiteer, etc.).As I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People, the reality we must come to terms with is that in the post-9/11 America we live in today, the government does whatever it wants, freedom be damned.The choices before us are straight-forward.We can live in the past, dwell on what freedoms we used to enjoy and shrug helplessly at the destruction of our liberties.We can immerse ourselves in the present, allowing ourselves to be utterly distracted by the glut of entertainment news and ever-changing headlines so that we fail to pay attention to or do anything about the government s ongoing power-grabs.We can hang our hopes on the future, believing against all odds that someone or something whether it be a politician, a movement, or a religious savior will save us from inevitable ruin.Or we can start right away by instituting changes at the local level, holding our government officials accountable to the rule of law, and resurrecting the Constitution, recognizing that if we fail to do so and instead follow our current trajectory, the picture of the future will be closer to what George Orwell likened to  a boot stamping on a human face forever.

REVEALED: Who Gave Democratic Emails To Wikileaks And Why They Were A Leaker And NOT A Hacker [VIDEO],"While all of the mainstream media and anonymous CIA sources claim that Russia was behind the hacks of the emails from the Democratic National Committee and top Clinton aide John Podesta, the truth has been revealed to be completely different.By way of background, top American intelligence veterans say that it was a leak, not a hack.A New York Times report on Monday alluding to  overwhelming circumstantial evidence  leading the CIA to believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin  deployed computer hackers with the goal of tipping the election to Donald J. Trump  is, sadly, evidence-free. This is no surprise, because harder evidence of a technical nature points to an inside leak, not hacking   by Russians or anyone else.Monday s Washington Post reports that Sen. James Lankford, R-Oklahoma, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has joined other senators in calling for a bipartisan investigation of suspected cyber-intrusion by Russia. Reading our short memo could save the Senate from endemic partisanship, expense and unnecessary delay.In what follows, we draw on decades of senior-level experience   with emphasis on cyber-intelligence and security   to cut through uninformed, largely partisan fog. Far from hiding behind anonymity, we are proud to speak out with the hope of gaining an audience appropriate to what we merit   given our long labors in government and other areas of technology. And corny though it may sound these days, our ethos as intelligence professionals remains, simply, to tell it like it is   without fear or favor.We have gone through the various claims about hacking. For us, it is child s play to dismiss them. The email disclosures in question are the result of a leak, not a hack. Here s the difference between leaking and hacking:Leak: When someone physically takes data out of an organization and gives it to some other person or organization, as Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning did.Hack: When someone in a remote location electronically penetrates operating systems, firewalls or any other cyber-protection system and then extracts data.Even the head of U.S. intelligence   James Clapper   testified on Monday that the connection between Russia and Wikileaks is weak. And U.S. intelligence agencies are now refusing to brief the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence on whether or not Russia was actually the source of the Wikileaks documents.And the NSA executive who created the agency s mass surveillance program for digital information, who served as the senior technical director within the agency, who managed six thousand NSA employees, the 36-year NSA veteran widely regarded as a  legend  within the agency and the NSA s best-ever analyst and code-breaker, who mapped out the Soviet command-and-control structure before anyone else knew how, and so predicted Soviet invasions before they happened ( in the 1970s, he decrypted the Soviet Union s command system, which provided the US and its allies with real-time surveillance of all Soviet troop movements and Russian atomic weapons )   told Washington s Blog that the Democratic emails were leaked by either NSA insiders or DNC insiders.The former intelligence analyst, British Ambassador to Uzbekistan, and chancellor of the University of Dundee (Craig Murray) revealed earlier this week that the Podesta leak and the DNC leak were leaked by two different insiders, that both of the leakers were Americans with no ties to Russia, and that one was from the American intelligence services.Subsequently, Murray revealed further details on the leaks.Specifically, in an interview with Scott Horton on Tuesday, Murray said that   because John Podesta s company is a registered lobbyist for the Saudi Arabian government   the NSA and other intelligence agencies were monitoring their emails as a matter of course.Murray said that an insider from an American intelligence service (read: NSA) leaked the Podesta emails to Wikileaks. Indeed, an intermediary to the NSA whistleblower handed the emails to Murray in a park in Washington, D.C.Murray said that Wikileaks head Julian Assange tells him that the leaker of the DNC emails was a DNC insider.When asked if Seth Rich was the DNC leaker, Murray responded that he doesn t know   but that it s possible that Rich was murdered because someone thought that he was the source of the DNC leak.  ZeroHedgeWatch this short interview with Wikileaks founder Julian Assange and John Pilger. Pay close attention to Assange s reaction when Pilger asks if he s suggesting Seth Rich was the leaker.Watch Assange s reaction to Pilger s question during the same interview in slow motion (below). What do you think? Is he nodding in agreement to his question about Seth Rich?THE RUSSIA HOAX: Julian Assange acknowledges murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich was Wikileaks' source. Why is MSM covering this up? #Trump pic.twitter.com/FS297JooQI  ViveLaFrance (@vivelafra) December 11, 2016Again, NSA is able to identify both the sender and recipient when hacking is involved. Thanks largely to the material released by Edward Snowden, we can provide a full picture of NSA s extensive domestic data-collection network including Upstream programs like Fairview, Stormbrew and Blarney. These include at least 30 companies in the U.S. operating the fiber networks that carry the Public Switched Telephone Network as well as the World Wide Web. This gives NSA unparalleled access to data flowing within the U.S. and data going out to the rest of the world, as well as data transiting the U.S.In other words, any data that is passed from the servers of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) or of Hillary Rodham Clinton (HRC)   or any other server in the U.S.   is collected by the NSA. These data transfers carry destination addresses in what are called packets, which enable the transfer to be traced and followed through the network.The bottom line is that the NSA would know where and how any  hacked  emails from the DNC, HRC or any other servers were routed through the network. This process can sometimes require a closer look into the routing to sort out intermediate clients, but in the end sender and recipient can be traced across the network.The various ways in which usually anonymous spokespeople for U.S. intelligence agencies are equivocating   saying things like  our best guess  or  our opinion  or  our estimate  etc.   shows that the emails alleged to have been  hacked  cannot be traced across the network. Given NSA s extensive trace capability, we conclude that DNC and HRC servers alleged to have been hacked were, in fact, not hacked.The evidence that should be there is absent; otherwise, it would surely be brought forward, since this could be done without any danger to sources and methods. Thus, we conclude that the emails were leaked by an insider   as was the case with Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning. Such an insider could be anyone in a government department or agency with access to NSA databases, or perhaps someone within the DNC.For entire story Washington s Blog"

 Chris Rock Perfectly ROASTS Lily White Oscars: ‘You’re Damn Right Hollywood Is Racist’ (VIDEO),"There has been a lot of tension lately regarding supposedly  liberal  Hollywood s overt racism. Many influential actors of color have chosen to boycott the biggest Hollywood awards show of the year for those gracing the silver screen, but one person was obligated to be there because he was hosting   comedian Chris Rock. However, that did not stop him from making his feelings known on the matter.He said that white liberals   especially in Hollywood   could be what he called  sorority racist.  They aren t overtly hateful, but they still practice racism without even realizing it. He used the equivalent of rushing Greek organizations on college campuses as a comparison, saying in that epically funny way that only Chris Rock can: We like you Ronda, but you re not a Kappa. Rock also went on to make fun of the supposed efforts of the Academy to make sure there was more diversity in the coming years, in both voters and nominees. Then, the most awkward moment ever happened, when Rock introduced none other than Clueless actress-turned-Fox-News-talking-head Stacey Dash as the new director of the Academy s  minority outreach program. And the winner for least funny #Oscars bit goes to @FoxNews' @REALStaceyDash: https://t.co/p0FsTAtxPe pic.twitter.com/Qao1iRSKsv  Matt Wilstein (@TheMattWilstein) February 29, 2016Now, if you recall, Dash is internalized racism personified. She has said that channels like BET should be done away with, and has complained about the Oscars boycott. Those examples are just the tip of the iceberg, because she is clearly the last person Black America needs representing us in Hollywood or anywhere else. Then again, knowing Chris Rock, this was completely on purpose.The thing is, Chris Rock is right. This  sorority racist  stuff is what minorities all over the place go through daily in this white supremacist society.No, we are not a post racial America, not by a long shot. Not even in  liberal  Hollywood.Well done, Mr. Rock, for saying what needed to be said.Featured image via video screen capture"
WHY HILLARY LOVES The Idea Of Barack Obama As Supreme Court Justice,"Remember when this would seem like a far-fetched idea? Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton said she  loves  the idea of appointing Barack Obama to the Supreme Court if she s elected president.At a campaign event in Iowa Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton told the crowd the next president may have to appoint up to three Supreme Court justices. When one attendee mentioned Mr. Obama as a contender, she seemed excited by the recommendation. Wow, what a great idea. No one has ever suggested that to me, I love that, wow,  Mrs. Clinton said.  He may have a few other things to do, but I tell you, that s a great idea. I mean, he s brilliant, he can set forth an argument and he was a law professor,  she added.  So he s got all the credentials, but we would have to get a Democratic Senate to get him confirmed. Via: Washington Times"
BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN Releases Anti-Trump Song Calling The President A “Con Man”,"Bruce Springsteen aka  The Boss  is showing all of his fans just how out of touch he is with his latest song. He s been a fervent anti-Trump guy and has been very outspoken against President Donald Trump. His new protest song refers to Trump as a  con man . What a way to disrespect the leader of our nation! has Bruce Springsteen employed thousands of Americans? It s interesting that Trump just delivered one of the best ever speeches to the builders union. Please watch the video provided below of what a real working man does for his crew. It s an awesome speech that totally discounts everything Springsteen is trying to say to bash Trump. Shame on him!The 67-year-old rocker released his and Joe Grushecky s anti-Trump song, called  That s What Makes Us Great,  and it is a direct comment on the president and his administration, according to Pitchfork.Springsteen s part of the song goes as follows: Don t tell me a lieAnd sell it as a factI ve been down that road beforeAnd I ain t going back.And don t you brag to meThat you never read a bookI never put my faithIn a con man and his crooks.  During an interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Gushecky talked about writing the song in January after Trump was sworn-in as president I had this song, and Bruce and I had been talking,  Grushecky said.  I sent it to him and he liked it. I said,  What do you think about singing on it?  He gave it the Bruce treatment. In February, Springsteen said he was an  embarrassed  American during a concert in Australia. On the same tour he attacked Trump s first travel ban as  un-American. Tonight we want to add our voice to the thousands of Americans who are protesting at airports around our country the Muslim ban and the detention of foreign nationals and refugees,  Springsteen told the crowd.  America is a nation of immigrants. This is fundamentally un-American. What a bunch of bull! Springsteen has lost his roots and his sense of the working man. If he cared to know anything about President Trump then he would know Trump s bringing back American jobs. He s working hard to get the steel industry up and running again. He just held a  Buy American, Hire American  event promoting keeping jobs in America. What s better than a president who s a builder speaking to builders and construction workers. In President Trump s speech he calls out people by name pretty great! He knows business and building. We re in good hands America!TRANSCRIPT: I want to thank Sean McGarvey and the entire governing board of presidents for honoring me with this great invitation. And I love that it s in Washington, because I don t have to travel very far. Worked out pretty well, I have to tell you. Five minutes.Sean took part in one of our very first meetings at the White House  - he mentioned it   and I promise you that America s labor leaders will always find an open door with Donald Trump. Always. (Applause.) Just look at the amazing talent assembled here. We have ironworkers, insulators   (applause)   never changes, does it, with the ironworkers? Let s hear it. Laborers. (Applause.) Painters. (Applause.) Fitters. (Applause.) Plumbers. (Applause.) Operators   they re operators, all right, I ll tell you that. (Laughter.) Electricians. (Applause.) Not that good. Where s my Local 3? Where s Local 3? That wasn t that good, the electricians   well, they became so rich they don t have to   (laughter)   let s do that again. Electricians. (Applause.) That s better.Bricklayers. (Applause.) Boilermakers. (Applause.) Elevator constructors. (Applause.) Good job. Sheet-metal workers. (Applause.) Roofers. (Applause.) Plasterers   plaster, well, yeah, that s   not using as much plaster as we used to, fellas, right? No matter how you cut it. Sorry about that. I m not sure I can do much   we brought back the coalminers. I m not so sure about the plasterers. We ll do the best we can, okay? We re going to do the best we can. How about the cement masons. (Applause.) And, of course, our wonderful Teamsters. (Applause.) Oh, that wasn t very good, James.But really, you re the backbone of America. With the talent in this room, we could build any city at any time, and we can build it better than anyone. (Applause.) But we re going to do even better than that. Together, we are going to rebuild our nation. (Applause.)You re the keepers of the great trades and traditions that built our country from the New York skyline to the Golden Gate Bridge. You represent the workers whose hands, skills, and dreams will build the great landmarks of our future. Every day, your members live out what I call the American Creed. They re on the job before dawn and after dusk, and they never quit until that job is done. You know that. True. True. (Applause.)We saw this grit on display when the construction trades helped rebuild New York City after 9/11. (Applause.) That was a terrible time   we were all there   that was a terrible time in this country s history. Worst attack in the history of our country. Worse than Pearl Harbor. Pearl Harbor they were attacking military. Here they were attacking civilians. Worst attack. And I saw what happened. Within a very short period of time, we were back rebuilding, and rebuild you did. And I really congratulate   that took a lot of courage and a lot of strength. Thank you. (Applause.)The fact is you take pride in every part of your work   every joist, bolt, and rivet. You re not only builders, but you re artisans, very talented people. A lot of people don t understand, you re very talented people   enriching our cities and landscapes with works of great beauty. And just as you take pride in your work, our nation takes great, great pride in you, believe me. And it s time that we give you the level playing field you deserve. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you.Washington and Wall Street have done very, very well for themselves.Now it s your turn.And you re going to be also sharing the wealth. (Applause.) And you know, for many years, we ve been taken advantage of by other countries. All over the world they took advantage of us. We had leaders that didn t have a clue or worse. That s not going to happen anymore, folks. That s not going to happen anymore. And you see what s going on right now. In fact, the trade deficit went way down   just announced before I got on stage. And I will tell you, we re going to have a whole different set of values when it comes to representing our country.That I can tell you right now. (Applause.)This election was all about returning power to the people. I ve spent my life working side-by-side with American builders, and now you have a builder as your President. (Applause.) One of my first acts as President was to stop one of the great sellouts of the American worker   I immediately withdrew the United States from the disaster   this would have been a disaster   this would have been another NAFTA, which, by the way, is a disaster. I took you out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. (Applause.) Thank you. That one wasn t even close. And you know it and I know it, everybody knows it.Next, I cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines. (Applause.) And it s looking like that s going to have about 42,000 jobs involved, those two jobs. That some number of great people. That s a big, big, beautiful   lot of people. And Sean actually, and a whole group joined me in the Oval Office when we approved the Keystone permit.And I joked that day   I said, can you imagine the head of this big Canadian company, in this case, they build pipelines   and they failed. Didn t work. They paid millions and millions and hundreds of millions of dollars to consultants and lawyers, and they failed. And it was over. And then one day Trump wins, and a few days later they get a knock on the door   sir, the Keystone pipeline was just approved.Can you imagine? I want to see the expression on his face. And he s a nice guy. He actually   they came to the office. (Applause.) Because I did say you have to use American steel, you have to fabricate it here. Now, they had already bought 60-70 percent of it. So you can t be too wild, right? But I was signing the order, and I said, where did they buy this steel? I didn t like the answer. I said, who fabricated the steel? I didn t like the answer. I said, from now on we re going to put a clause   got to be made in America. We want American steel, made in America. (Applause.) Right on the box. 100 percent, right? (Applause.)And you ll be hearing more about this in the very near future. But as time goes by, let s say, over the next seven and three-quarters years   meaning eight years   (laughter.)We believe in two simple rules: Buy American, and Hire American. That s what it s going to be. (Applause.) And that s not just a slogan, it s a promise. Believe me, that s a promise. (Applause.)The era of economic surrender has come to an end. It s come to an end. We have surrendered as a country to outside interests. The era of economic victory for our country has just begun. You will see. No longer will we listen to those failed consultants who ve made one wrong prediction after another   delivering nothing but soaring trade deficits and a big, fat, shrinking workforce.For decades now, we ve watched as our factories have shuttered   almost 70,000 factories   our jobs have been stolen, and blue collar wages have declined. We ve seen the economic pain inflicted on our fellow Americans in Pittsburgh and Detroit and Baltimore. We didn t just offshore our jobs, we offshored a big, big part of the American Dream.We enriched foreign countries at the expense of our own country, the great United States of America. But those days are over. (Applause.) I m not   and I don t want to be   the President of the world. I m the President of the United States. And from now on, it s going to be America First. (Applause.)We re going to bring back our jobs   and, yes, we re going to bring back the American Dream. As I traveled the nation, I heard the pleas of the forgotten men and women of our country   the people who work hard and play by the rules, but who don t have a voice. Together, we are their voice, and they will never, ever be forgotten again. That I can tell you. (Applause.)I don t know if you saw, but if you watch the Democrats now, the anger   the anger and hatred, and they re trying to figure out where did all these people came that voted for Donald Trump? Remember they said   because the Electoral College is a very, very hard, they say, almost impossible for a Republican to win. The odds are stacked. And they would say there s no way to 270   you need 270   there s no way to 270. I heard that so much for a year   I kept saying, maybe I shouldn t be running. You know, Sean, I said, maybe I shouldn t run because there s no way. The people are telling me   the same people that say all of the bad stuff, they re saying, there s no way to 270. But there was a way to 306.But wasn t that an exciting one? Places that nobody entered   Donald Trump has won the state of Michigan. They go, what? Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin. They came out of the blue, and we didn t even need them. And we love those two states   because we won the state of Pennsylvania, and we won Ohio, and Iowa, and North Carolina, and South Carolina, and Florida, and so many others. We ran the coast. And if you don t run it, you can t win. Huge disadvantage, Electoral College. It s very, very tough. They say almost impossible for a Republican to win. But I had the support of, I would say, I would say almost everybody in this room.We had tremendous   we had tremendous support. Oh, we did. We had tremendous support. (Applause.) We had tremendous support. And I ll tell you, we really had the support of the workers. We had tremendous support of the workers. But would you like to make a change, folks? Would you like to make a change? Because if anybody wants to make a change, you won t be having so many jobs. That I can tell you. Your jobs will be   it will be a whole different story. Because in the last decade, you lost over 750,000   think of this   750,000 construction jobs. Real wages in the construction sector have fallen more than 15 percent since the 1970s. We rank 39th in the world for construction permitting. And approvals for infrastructure projects can take up to 10 years.Since taking office, I ve signed one action after another to eliminate job-killing regulations that stand in the way. I had a chart   is that chart around here someplace? Do you have that? I have to show this chart to you because it s amazing, actually.This is   if you want to build a highway in the United States, these are some of the permits that you need. It s a process that can take way over 10 years. And it just never happens. Then at the end of the period they vote against it. And we re getting rid of many of these regulations. (Applause.) You have to go through 17 agencies, many permits in each agency.In February alone, we added almost 60,000 new construction jobs in the country. I ordered expedited environmental reviews for infrastructure, environmental and energy projects all across the country. No longer will you have to wait year after year for approvals that never come.I also took historic action to lift the restrictions on American energy production and to put our miners, who have been treated horribly, back to work. (Applause.) They re great people.Consumer confidence is at its highest level in more than a decade. You ve seen all of the charts, all of the studies. The National Association of Manufacturers just the other day reported the most optimism in the entire history of its survey   which is a old survey   93 percent of manufacturers are optimistic about the future. It was almost 27 percent lower than that just a few months ago.The Home Builders Confidence Index is at its highest level in 12 years. And now in breaking news, it was just reported today, the monthly U.S. trade deficit declined by 10 percent   for a reason. Not by accident, believe me. It was for a reason.We re also going to protect your jobs by protecting our borders. My administration is   just a matter of weeks, literally, a short period of time   has brought record reductions to illegal immigration. Record reductions. (Applause.) Down 61 percent since inauguration. General Kelly is doing a fantastic job. And we ll crack down on visa abuses that undermine the American worker. And we re doing that right now. (Applause.)These, and so many other great achievements, have defined our first 10 weeks in office. We ve done so much for the worker. Done so much for the military. We ve done so much for the police officers, our men in blue and women in blue who are not treated fairly. We re fighting for workers of all backgrounds and from all walks of life.But to achieve true progress, we must remember our legacy. We re the nation that built the tallest skyscrapers on what was once the Hudson River, and put neon lights of Las Vegas in the middle of the desert. But if government continues to punish America s builders, then we will not be that nation any longer.I m calling on all Americans   Democrat, Republican, independent   to come together and take part in the great rebuilding of our country. (Applause.)That is why, in my address to Congress, I called on lawmakers to pass legislation that produces a $1-trillion investment in the infrastructure of our country. And we need it. (Applause.) With your help, we can rebuild our country s bridges, airports, seaports, and water systems. We will streamline the process to get approvals quickly, so that long-delayed projects can finally move ahead. And with lower taxes on America s middle class and businesses, we will see a new surge of economic growth and development.All of you have come to the nation s capital to call members of the House and Senate to action. You ve also called your President to action. When you see them, you can tell Congress that America s building trades and its President are very much united. (Applause.)Together, we are ready to break new ground. We will build in the spirit of one of the great projects in our nation s history   an enduring symbol of American strength. The Empire State Building was forged in the Great Depression, and provided jobs for more than 3,000 workers. We ve all seen the pictures   rugged workers perched dozens and dozens of stories up in the air. Workers like these moved almost 60,000 tons of steel, installed 200,000 cubic feet of stone, and laid 10 million bricks to build that American icon. And they did the job in a record time   13 months. Hard to believe. Think of that   the Empire State Building built in 13 months, during the Depression. Nowadays, you couldn t even get a building permit or approval in that amount of time.When the workers had secured the last piece of steel in that amazing and beautiful structure, they marked the moment   as we still do today   with what is called a  topping out  ceremony: 1.050 feet above the streets of New York City, they hoisted a beautiful and great American flag. (Applause.)AUDIENCE MEMBER: The ironworkers!THE PRESIDENT: They did a good job. They did a good   those ironworkers, you better believe it.It was an American flag that represented American projects   the big, bold, and daring dream of one man, and then one city, and then finally, one people. That banner marked our nation s proud climb to the top of the world. Our people endured through the hardships of Depression and the battles of World War II, and they emerged from these trials stronger and more united than ever before. Now, we must again summon that same national greatness to meet the challenges of our time.Only miles from the halls of Congress and the newsrooms of Washington, you will find once-thriving cities marred by empty lots and once-booming industrial towns that have become rusted and are in total disrepair. Standing before me today, in this very hall, are the men and women who, if given the chance, can transform these communities. You are the citizens who can rebuild our cities, revive our industries, and renew our beloved country. And I know you will stop at nothing to get the job done. (Applause.)For the rest of their lives, everyone who worked on the Empire State Building knew when they looked up at that great New York skyline that they had lifted the Stars and Stripes atop the tallest flagpole on Earth, and that somewhere high above the city streets, their place in history was carved into beams of steel.In the future, when we become   the trials   and we are   trials of our times   we too will emerge stronger and more united than ever before. It s happening, you watch. When we rise above the cynics and critics who live only to defend the status quo, and to defend themselves from failure, then we, too, will construct a lasting monument to national greatness.In this future, our nation s workers and craftsmen will look way out at the vast open landscape, and they will build new bridges and new schools and new landmarks, and they will proudly raise up for all to see our bright and beautiful American flag. And when we see that flag, we will remember that we all share one American home, one American heart, and one American destiny.May God bless our nation s builders. May God bless our nation s workers. And may God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.)"
#YouveBeenTrumped…Journalist Who Tried To Nail Donald Trump Jr. On Russia Story For Over A Year Has Full-Scale Meltdown After Trump Jr. Releases Emails On Twitter,"This is the dumbest and biggest crime in the history of American politics. There's not even a close second.  Jared Yates Sexton (@JYSexton) July 11, 2017It turns out little Jared was wrong. The Donald Trump Jr.-Russian collusion story is not only another nothing burger, it lends more credibility to the theory that the media is on an all-out witch hunt for President Donald Trump. Apparently, the hunt has now been extended to include members of the Trump family.Yates Sexton started his rant on Twitter by whining to his followers about chasing the story for a year, and how he got  Trumped  by Don Jr. when, much like his father, Jr. went around the media and took to Twitter to post the emails journalists were desperate to get their hands on.I chased this story for a year and he just tweeted it out.  Jared Yates Sexton (@JYSexton) July 11, 2017Whining journalist part 2:Like. I spent hours and days and weeks and months. And his son just, hit tweet.  Jared Yates Sexton (@JYSexton) July 11, 2017More whining:I tracked down sources. Followed so many dead leads. Labored over this. And then, he just, you know, tweeted out the proof.  Jared Yates Sexton (@JYSexton) July 11, 2017Still more whining:Like, so many people out there were trying to track this down. And it just got delivered on a tweet. What the hell.  Jared Yates Sexton (@JYSexton) July 11, 2017And you guessed it more whining!It's just so bizarre. As an independent journalist you work crazy hard hoping something will fall into your lap and he tweeted it? 2/  Jared Yates Sexton (@JYSexton) July 11, 2017And then, the fake relief over the release of the nothing burger emails by none other than Donald Trump Jr. himself:For the record, I'm beside myself in relief that this stuff is out there it's just my god. I cannot believe this.  Jared Yates Sexton (@JYSexton) July 11, 2017Yates Sexton then turned his ire on Trump supporters who apparently are (gasp!) laughing at the rabid leftist media who won t let the fake Trump-Russian collusion narrative go:The son of the president just released the smoking gun and the people are laughing about it on the news.  Jared Yates Sexton (@JYSexton) July 11, 2017Poor Jared he s, well, he appears to be  baffled  by the Trump s and how they don t follow the rules that have been put forth by the media:This is the most baffling day in a long, long stretch of baffling days.  Jared Yates Sexton (@JYSexton) July 11, 2017And finally, in an appeal to his leftist fans who are surely as heartbroken as him, Yates Sexton suggests that if his followers like his style of dead-end reporting, perhaps they would enjoy paying $22.69 for his book. And now for the final test Will love Trump hate? Will liberals feel help poor little Jared feel better about wasting over a year of his life, while he chased his tail, pinning all of his hopes on being  the one  who finally found the Trump-Russia connection.If you do want to read my reporting, however, here's my book that's out in September.https://t.co/02qE5K9PFv  Jared Yates Sexton (@JYSexton) July 11, 2017"
 NYC Cop Under Investigation After Being Busted With Instagram Account Full Of Violence (TWEETS),"New York City Officer Matthew Langone sure does love his Instagram account. It is also the reason he is now facing an investigation.While off duty, Langone moonlights as a producer of pro-cop merchandise. There would be nothing wrong with this, except for one little fact: the merchandise blatantly advocates for police violence against members of the community. In fact, at least one t-shirt is the very definition of fascism.The latest shirt from the Langone collection boasts zip tie wrist cuffs shaped like a heart, with the slogan,  I [heart] protesters.  The  OT  in protesters is in blue, clearly promoting the widely popular police narrative that they rake in the bucks from all the overtime they get policing the ever-increasing number of protests. Keegan Stephan, an activist against police brutality, discovered the photos on Langone s Instagram account and uploaded them to twitter. Here is the image:Officer Langone of the @NYPD103Pct doesn't think much of free speech, except of course as ""OT."" pic.twitter.com/SGODDv8Nwh  Keegan Stephan (@KeeganNYC) January 12, 2016If you think that s bad, you ain t seen nothing yet. Suspecting more horrible content lay within the confines of Langone s Instagram, Stephan kept looking. He found it to be full of horrible memes and derogatory language directed at the very people this cop is sworn to serve and protect. Here are just a few:In fact, his whole instagram account is pretty unbecoming of an officer, imo, @NYPD103Pct. https://t.co/gABdz1zpHj pic.twitter.com/xM1myPSziZ  Keegan Stephan (@KeeganNYC) January 12, 2016To be clear, this appears to be an active duty cop w/the @NYPD103Pct posting this filth: https://t.co/gABdz1zpHj pic.twitter.com/zq9bSlGfNB  Keegan Stephan (@KeeganNYC) January 12, 2016It s the last meme, in which Langone refers to community members as  hoodrats,  that got the attention of Rory Lancman, of the Queens City Council. Lancman called on the 103rd precinct, at which Langone works as an active duty officer, for an investigation. Lancman said of the posts: I m deeply disturbed by the reprehensible Instagram posts of a police officer in the 103rd Precinct, which covers a significant portion of my district. It s completely unacceptable for someone who has sworn to protect our city to post messages advocating violence and referring to community members as  hood rats.  Such comments erode public confidence in our police and undermine our efforts to improve police-community relations. I urge the NYPD to take immediate disciplinary action and make it clear that such behavior will not be tolerated. But of course, the Blue wall of silence is always more important, than, you know, keeping the community safe from a cop with fantasies of fascism and violence and who clearly has nothing but contempt for the people who live there. The cops at the precinct only had this to say: We want to make sure that the posts are his. How many fake Instagram and Twitter pages are out there? Someone may have been putting this out in his name. How convenient. Even more insidious is that they have now blocked Keegan Stephan from following their precinct on Twitter. Stephan posted the proof:Wow, way to deal with the problem, @NYPD103Pct. pic.twitter.com/Vtugh5V76i  Keegan Stephan (@KeeganNYC) January 12, 2016I think, after this, it is safe to say that their  investigation,  will just be another in a long line of countless cases where they investigate themselves and determine that there was no wrongdoing.Featured image via screen capture from Raw Story"
BREAKING: TRUMP Announces “Phenomenal” Tax Cut Plan For Businesses In Next 2-3 Weeks…Stock Markets Respond [VIDEO],"President Donald Trump said his administration would be announcing a  big league  tax cut that would lower the burden on businesses within the next two or three weeks.The revelation saw the Dow Jones industrial average rise around 115 points to a record, with Goldman Sachs contributing the most gains. Lowering the overall tax burden on American business is big league, that s coming along very well,  Trump said at the top of a White House meeting with airline industry executives Thursday.  We re way ahead of schedule, I believe. And we re going to be announcing something   I would say over the next two or three weeks   that will be phenomenal. The president s comment had an immediate effect on the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies.The administration had gotten pushback a day earlier from conservative web site proprietor Matt Drudge, an influential media figure who Trump regularly lauded during the campaign. Republican party should be sued for fraud. NO discussion of tax cuts now. Just lots of crazy. Back to basics, guys!  Drudge tweeted, on a day filled with fallout from the Senate effort to silence liberal Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren.Tax reform has also been a top priority for House Speaker Paul Ryan and others in the GOP congressional majority, which has been anxious to slash taxes and regulations now that it finally has an ally in the White House.Trump has pledged to cut the top corporate tax rate from 35 per cent to 15 per cent, but he offered no details on what his proposal might be. The value of the dollar against the Japanese yen jumped by 1 percentage point after the president s comments, Reuters reported. Airline stocks also spiked after the meeting. All three major market indexes jumped on news of the tax cut timetable.  Daily Mail "
AMERICA’S OLDEST Suit Manufacturer Drops NFL Ads: “Our companies will not condone unpatriotic behavior!”,"Two years ago, Cleveland, Tenn., businessman Allan Jones was proudly showing off his newly acquired Hardwick Clothing-brand suits by providing the wardrobe for NBC s on-air talent during the network s broadcasts of NFL football games.But after NFL players and coaches challenged President Donald Trump and many took a knee during the national anthem played before their games over the weekend, Jones said he is through sponsoring the wardrobes or advertising on stations that air the National Football League.Jones, CEO of the payday lending chain Check Into Cash and owner of Hardwick Clothes   America s oldest suitmaker   tweeted his criticism and change of heart Tuesday. Our companies will not condone unpatriotic behavior!  said Jones, CEO of the payday lending chain Check Into Cash and owner of Hardwick Clothes   America s oldest suit maker.  For the 29 states we operate in, this isn t much to them, but it s a lot to us. The Tombras Group is our ad agency in Knoxville and our national media buyer for both TV and radio (for Check Into Cash) and don t look for Hardwick on the NFL either. Jones, a strong supporter of Trump, directed his media buyer, the Tombras Group in Knoxville, to remove any commercials for Check Into Cash, Buy Here Pay Here USA, or U.S. Money Stores from airing during NFL games  for the entire season.   Times Free PressAllan Jones appeared on Fox and Friends shortly after Donald Trump s inauguration to express his enthusiasm for his presidency and for his willingness to make American manufacturing a priority. Watch:The Story of Hardwick Clothes, Inc.Hardwick manufacturing plant is located on the outskirts of Cleveland, TN. The expansive new facility and modernized manufacturing equipment helped Hardwick stay competitive against an increasing supply of cheap, offshore clothing.Hardwick s reputation for American-made quality has helped the company survive and thrive in the face of outsourcing and cost-cutting. This status has helped Hardwick land contracts with a wide range of large clients, including the U.S. military and Major League Baseball umpires.Since its founding in 1880, Hardwick Clothes has endured factory fires, economic recessions, two World Wars, inflation and leisure suits. Despite these challenges, Hardwick Clothes has continued to produce unsurpassed suits, pants, and jackets for men and women, operating successfully with pride and quality.In June 2014, the company was acquired by Allan Jones, a prominent Cleveland, Tennessee, entrepreneur. Jones stated that Hardwick appealed to him because it was the oldest business of its kind in America. He announced his commitment to increased investment in the firm to help it regain its rightful status at the summit of the American clothing industry. "
PRICELESS! BILL MAHER CALLS Senator Elizabeth Warren “Pocahontas” During Interview [VIDEO],"Bill Maher began his interview with the yawn-inducing Democrat Senator Elizabeth Warren and the best hope for a presidential candidate in 2020, by hitting her with some bad news Democrats are losing. After she came out faking enthusiasm for the liberal California audience, Warren who is best known for lying on a job application to Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania, where she checked the  Native American  box, starts out telling Maher,  People all across this country are energized.  (Is she talking about Antifa and basement dwellers who are collecting a paycheck from various George Soros groups for occasionally rolling out of bed, grabbing a face-mask and a baseball bat from their father s garage and going out to threaten the free-speech of Trump supporters?)Maher reminded her,  They may be all energized but they don t have a Democratic governor, a Democratic senator or a Democratic parliament. The first 5 minutes of Warren s yawn-inducing interview is filled with whining about how her progressive agenda is being ignored and how capitalism needs to be addressed and taken down.Maher quickly reminds her that from 1980-2015 when many of the economy-killing regulations were implemented that many Democrats were responsible for passing. He asked her,  Don t the Democrats bear some responsibility for that? At about the 6 minute mark, Bill Maher begins to whine about Trump s tax plan and reminds  Pocahontas  that Trump s fans are not with her. Warren tells Maher,  Actually, I m gonna push back, I disagree.  Maher interrupts her,  His fans are not with you. They don t like you Pocahontas. Watch starting at the 6:00 minute mark:"
 Alabama County Succeeds In Re-Instituting School Segregation,"The Republican-controlled southern states have done very little in recent years to scale back the impact of America s history of racism, from stubbornly supporting the Confederate flag on government property to retorting  All Lives Matter  to the Black Lives Matter movement, as well as dismissing all concerns posed by institutional, systemic, and overt racism prevalent throughout the country.In Sumter County, Alabama, a quarter of the county s children are white, but not a single one of them attends a public school. A report by Dan Carsen of a local NPR affiliate on the county s school district shows the schools are in terrible shape due to neglect and lack of funding precipitated by school segregation. They live in this county, but they will not send their children to the schools in this county,  Sumter School County Board Member Julene Delaine told Dan Carsen in an interview.  Instead, many white families send their kids to a local private academy or outside the area.  We shop in the same place. We eat at the same restaurant. So why can t our kids go to school together? Carsen also reported that while other states provide extra funding to low income school districts, Alabama does not. The state also refuses to increase taxes to compensate for the needed income. Alabama s Republican Governor, Robert Bentley, has gained a notorious reputation for corruption and abuse. He has recently been accused of having an affair with a political aide, increasing pay of his staff substantially despite the state s budget concerns after he blocked a minimum wage increase in the city of Birmingham, and is using over $1 million in taxpayer money to remodel a second Governor s mansion.In contrast to Sumter County s public schools, not a single person of color can be found in photos of Sumter County s  private school, Sumter Academy. The school s website also touts that it is a Christian based learning environment. Under the veil of emphasizing privatization over government ownership and regulation, the Christian Right has been able to succeed in inoculating themselves from having to adhere to federal laws protecting the rights of black people and other marginalized groups.Featured image courtesy of Flickr"
OBAMA’S SPEECH ABOUT “CHILD SAFETY” Was Interrupted When Rapper Guest’s Ankle Bracelet From KIDNAPPING Charge Went Off,"We told you about the fancy affair Obama was planning to host at the White House for black rappers last week. The latest development with the ankle bracelet on a criminal rapper makes you want to scream, Are you kidding me? An attempt by President Obama to promote his  My Brother s Keeper  initiative, which aims to keep youths of color out of trouble, came to a farcical end when rapper Rick Ross s ankle bracelet   which he received on a kidnapping and assault charge   went off.Obama had invited a bevy of hip-hop heavyweights, including Niki Minaj, Common, Busta Rhymes, Pusha T and DJ Khaled, to the meeting at the White House Friday.But none of them   least of all Ross himself   expected the ankle bracelet to interrupt the president, according to TMZ.Obama reportedly invited the stars to the  serious and fancy affair,  which was not made public before the event, to promote the initiative.It was so serious, in fact, that Ross, who is typically photographed topless to show off his impressive all-over body tattoos, wore a smart suit   and a pair of black Adidas sneakers.That suit conveniently covered the ankle bracelet that he received after last year s kidnapping, assault and battery charges. Unfortunately, it wasn t able to block the sound of his new anklet s random beeps   one of which went off just as Obama was finishing his speech.Even the self-styled  Hood Billionaire  was surprised at the sound, a source said.He later posted a picture of himself and DJ Khaled talking after the event on his Instagram account.

Limousine Liberal Leo DeCaprio Joins Globalist John Kerry: Climate Deniers Like Trump Shouldn’t Hold Office [Video],"Two hypocrite climate change freaks decided to pontificate to a packed house at Yale. Both John Kerry and Leo DeCaprio love to hear themselves talk so this had to be a snoozefest. The most ironic thing about the preaching on global warming coming from these two men is that they have HUGE carbon footprints. Does Leo not understand that we know he travels by private jet and big yacht What a joke! These two blow hard limousine liberals are why Trump won.At a Yale University talk hosted by former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, Leonardo DiCaprio says that politicians who do not believe in the  facts and truth  of climate change should not be in office.The New Haven Register spoke glowingly of the overflow crowd and the mission  the planet s future is at risk :Actor Leonardo DiCaprio and former Secretary of State John Kerry Tuesday urged Yale students to become a political force to fight global warming because the planet s future is at risk. The popular actor was joined on the stage at Woolsey Hall by Kerry, the 2004 Democratic presidential nominee who lost to incumbent President George W. Bush but was Secretary of State from 2013-2017. An enthusiastic crowd filled the 2,650 seats of the old hall, including the balconies. The event climaxed a two-day climate change conference hosted by the Kerry Initiative that addresses global challenges.DeCaprio donated $20 million to the cause:Leonardo DiCaprio just donated a $20 million grant to help combat climate change Tuesday evening during the speech at Yale University.We must demand that politicians accept climate science and make bold commitments before it is too late. I still believe that the United States has the potential to lead the world on this issue,  DiCaprio said.  We can only hope that the President begins to see it too, before it is too late. "
WHAT? DEMOCRAT CONGRESSWOMAN Calls Violent Riots At Berkeley A “Beautiful Thing” [Video],"Here s just one video from last night that will tell you all you need to know: We have seen demonstrations   and I think you already talked about that   around the country. Young people at Berkeley protesting against this unconstitutional order. And I heard it say earlier that we need to get involved on the local and state level. But what concerns me is that the strain that has been placed on local government, particularly local law enforcement dealing with an order that is unjust and proper. And so as we encourage our young people to get involved   I thought it was a beautiful site   as we encourage people to get involved, what direction and instructions and how can we have a more organized effort so that they can be a major tool in moving our agenda forward? Anyone who feels that they can answer this question? Thank you. "
DISGRACEFUL: US Air Force Can No Longer Afford 21-Gun Salute At Vet Funerals…Plenty Of Funds For Muslim Immigrants,"We can t afford to give our US Veterans a proper funeral, but we ve got money to burn when it comes to bringing Muslim refugees to the US from countries who hate us. On average, each Middle Eastern refugee resettled in the United States costs an estimated $64,370 in the first five years, or $257,481 per household. When a veteran or member of the armed forces dies, he or she is entitled to a ceremony that includes the presentation of a U.S. flag to a family member and a bugler blowing Taps. Most of the time, there is a three-volley rifle salute if requested by family members. But now, if the deceased served in the Air Force, the three-volley salute is not an option because the Air Force can no longer support riflemen for funeral services for veteran retirees.Seven member services for retirees included six members to serve as pall-bearers, a six member flag-folding detail, and a three riflemen to fire the salute. Veteran s funerals now only receive the services of two-member teams, who provide a flag-folding ceremony, the playing of taps, and the presentation of the flag to the next of kin. To me, without the 21-gun salute, it just does not make it complete a proper military burial,  veteran Wayne Wakeman told Honolulu s KHON 2 News.  I think because of sequestration or the lack of funds or whatever excuse they re giving, that they had to hit the veterans. Wakeman is correct in supposing the cut is due to sequestration, the 2013 automatic federal spending cuts required by the Budget Control Act of 2011.Rose Richeson, from the Secretary of the Air Force s Public Affairs Press Desk, told We Are The Mighty the policy of restricting the funeral honor is an Air Force-wide requirement. The requirement is consistent with DoD policy which require a minimum of two personnel,  Richeson said.  Any number of personnel above two that is provided in support of military funeral honors is based on local resources available.  Via: FOX News"
 The GOP Just Revealed What They REALLY Think About ‘National Security’,"Congressional Republicans plan on dogging Hillary and the FBI about her emails and use of a private server from now until kingdom come. It s a matter of mishandling classified info, they say. She potentially put our national security at grave risk, they claim. We have to investigate every last letter of every last word of every last sentence here, they insist. But when it comes to investigating a true threat to national security, they re blocking attempts at every turn.Of course, we re talking about Donald Trump s potential ties to Russia. Congressional Democrats keep running into roadblock after roadblock in trying to open an investigation into that. GOP staffers told The Daily Beast that while it seems their bosses are privately concerned about the issue, they would rather continue harping on Hillary.It s politics. Disgusting politics that really does put us at risk. The problem is likely that Trump is their nominee which really should make it all the more concerning. Given the GOP s apparent need to protect our security (they re angry with Obama for not going after ISIS the way they want in addition to insisting that Hillary jeopardized our security with her email server), one would think they d be all over this.Intelligence briefings given to both the Senate and House Intelligence Committees point to Russia using hacking as a means to influence our elections: Communications and documents stolen in those hacks have been selectively leaked online since, by a hacker claiming to be unaffiliated with the Russians going by  Guccifer 2.0.  But analysis by private-sector cybersecurity firms have concluded that the character is most likely a front for the Russians to cast doubt on their culpability.Two other hacks   both of state election boards   have also been loosely tied to potential Russian hackers. In Illinois, thousands of voter role records were accessed, and Arizona was also targeted. Though nothing was done to influence elections in those states, experts believe Russian hacking is designed to cast doubt in the security and validity of the election. It s true that some Republicans are suffering some measure of  buyer s remorse  over the party s nomination of Trump, but in blocking investigations that are this important, all they ve done is unmask themselves as the impostors they are. To some, this is black-and-white. Kurt Eichenwald of Newsweek went on Twitter to call them out for this blatant hypocrisy:GOP Congress spends a year and a half investigating Clinton emails, but refuses to investigate whether Russia is hacking our election? WTF?  Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) September 30, 2016And he s got it. Republicans have attacked Hillary on everything under the sun because they hate her, and they fear her, and they don t want her to be president. It s not about national security with her. They won t go after Trump for something far more dangerous and frightening because they re protecting their own. It s Republican politics at its finest.Featured image via Aude Guerrucci-Pool/Getty Images"

 Controversial Former Fox CEO Roger Ailes Dead At 77,"It has been reported that embattled former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes passed away this morning at his home in Palm Beach, Florida. The news was confirmed in a statement given to Drudge Report by his wife, Elizabeth Ailes. Elizabeth Ailes  statement on her husband s passing.Roger Ailes was born on May 15th, 1940 in Warren, Ohio. He attended Ohio University and graduated with a bachelor s  degree in radio and television. His long career in television began in 1962 as a production assistant for The Mike Douglas Show, a local talk show. In 1967, Richard Nixon appeared on the program, and Ailes argued with him about the political importance of television. That lead Nixon to hire Ailes to produce television for his campaign. After getting his foot in the door with Nixon, Ailes worked on two other presidential campaigns and helped Rudy Giuliani get elected mayor of New York City. He went on to become the president of CNBC in 1993, before being hired as CEO of Fox News in 1996. Ailes unique style of management and fearless approach to controversy have completely changed conservative broadcasting.Ailes was forced out of Fox News after allegations of sexual harassment came to light by some of the network s most popular and high-profile talent.A 2016 lawsuit by Gretchen Carlson alleges that Ailes retaliated against her for speaking out about his sexist treatment, denying her promotions and stalling her advancement.Megyn Kelly backed up Carlson s version of events, and went public with details of her own sexual harassment by Ailes when she was a young reporter.Lorie Luhn, who booked guests for the network, told of over 20 years of abuse. According her statements to New York Magazine, one time Ailes put her in charge of finding young talent for the network and told her,  You re going to find me  Roger s Angels.  You re going to find me whores. Andrea Tantaros was demoted and taken off of the air for refusing to hug Ailes.RNC field consultant Kelly Boyle was told by Ailes,  You know if you want to play with the big boys, you have to lay with the big boys.  Rudi Bakhtiar was fired by Fox after refusing to wear mini-skirts that Ailes sent her after a job interview in which he made her stand and show off her legs.Shelley Ross published an article in The Daily Beast where she detailed harassment and abuse she endured from Ailes, including suggestions that they form a  sexual alliance  in order for Ross to prove her loyalty.On the set of The Mike Douglas Show, model Marsha Callahan says she was told by Ailes that he could help her advance her career if she put on a garter belt and stockings, then lifted her skirt to show Ailes.Photo by Stephen Lovekin via Getty Images."
 Trump Finally Admitted Something He Really Hasn’t Done His Whole Campaign (TWEET),"Throughout Donald Trump s entire campaign, it s been the Donald Trump show. What does that mean? He s made it all about himself. How well HE is doing. What poll numbers HE is getting. What HE can do for the country. How great HE is. He s been saying all of these things as if he s doing all of this on his own without any help from anyone.Well, in a turn of events, Trump just tweeted out something on Twitter that seems to acknowledge, at least in parentheses, that he hasn t clinched the Republican nomination for president completely on his own. There were actually voters involved.He wrote: I (we) broke the all-time record for most votes gotten in a Republican Primary   by a lot   and with many states left to go! Thank you. I (we) broke the all-time record for most votes gotten in a Republican Primary   by a lot   and with many states left to go! Thank you.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 28, 2016This is YUUGE for The Donald to recognize that he s not actually moving forward to the general election based upon himself alone. He actually needed votes to get there, and it s nice that he kinda-sorta-maybe in parentheses alongside himself acknowledged the people who got him to where he is.Trump s narcissism knows no bounds, but maybe, just maybe he finally figured out how elections actually work. And because the rest of us already knew, we need to make sure he gets nowhere near the White House come November.Featured Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images"
BROTHER OF SETH RICH Works For Cyber Security Firm…Reportedly BLOCKED Family’s Private Investigator From Determining If Seth Was Wikileaks Source…Refused To Let Investigator See Seth’s Computer: “I already checked it…Don’t worry about it”,"What the heck is going on? Why is the media, who has been virtually silent about former DNC staffer Seth Rich s death until now, coming out to attack President Trump and his administration, accusing them of pushing a false narrative about his murder? Shouldn t every American regardless of political affiliation want to get to the bottom of Rich s suspicious death? Why is there so much secrecy and mystery surrounding the staffer who was getting ready to move over to the Hillary campaign when he was murdered on the streets of DC, only blocks from his home early in the morning, after he was last seen leaving a local bar he frequented. The DC police called it a robbery. The  robbers  didn t take his wallet, the contents of his wallet or his expensive watch.Aaron Rich, who had reportedly been blocking his family s private investigator from looking into whether or not his brother Seth was a WikiLeaks source, works for an influential defense contractor that provides cyber security.According to a source close to the Rich family, Aaron works for Northrup Grumman, which was named as the fifth-largest defense contractor in the world in 2015. The source did not provide what his specific role is at the company. It s not just hacking and defending, there s a lot more to it,  a cyber software engineer at Northrup Grumman says in a video on the company s website.As we previously reported, Aaron Rich was actively attempting to shut down anyone looking into the WikiLeaks connection according to Rod Wheeler, who was brought on as a private investigator in his brother s murder case.Wheeler said that brother Aaron Rich tried to block Wheeler from looking at Seth s computer, even though there could be evidence on it.  He said no, he said I have his computer, meaning him,  Wheeler said.  I said, well can I look at it? He said, what are you looking for? I said anything that could indicate if Seth was having problems with someone. He said no, I already checked it. Don t worry about it. Aaron also blocked Wheeler from finding out about who was at a party Seth attended the night of the murder. All I want you to do is work on the botched robbery theory and that s it,  Aaron told Wheeler, according to Wheeler s claim on the audio. Wheeler said that Seth s father Joel  does not appear to have any hidden agenda. Rich was shot in the back in the early morning hours of July 10, 2016, near his home while he was on the phone with his girlfriend   12 days before the publication of the DNC emails by WikiLeaks. The police initially ruled that it was a botched robbery   but his wallet, watch, and necklace were still on his person when he was discovered by police.Big League Politics has also released an audio recording of journalist Seymour Hersh stating that Seth Rich was in fact WikiLeaks  source.Listen to the Seymour Hersh interview here: All I know is that he offered a sample, an extensive sample, I m sure dozens of emails, and said  I want money.  Later, WikiLeaks did get the password, he had a DropBox, a protected DropBox,  he said. They got access to the DropBox. Hersh also states that Rich had concerns about something happening to him,  the word was passed, according to the NSA report, he also shared this DropBox with a couple of friends, so that  if anything happens to me it s not going to solve your problems,  he added.  WikiLeaks got access before he was killed. For entire story: Big League Politics "
TRUMP RETWEETS HILARIOUS Video Of Him Hitting Golf Ball That Hits Crooked Hillary In The Head…Left Goes NUTS!,"On September 13, President Trump warned Hillary on Twitter that the Americans she referred to as the  deplorabes  would come back to haunt her, as she travels around the nation on her  blame anyone and everyone but me  book signing tour for her embarrassing new book  What Happened .The ""deplorables"" came back to haunt Hillary.They expressed their feelings loud and clear. She spent big money but, in the end, had no game!  Donald J.

The funniest video clip or GIF, came from  Mike  who sent a hilarious video of President Trump golfing and then showing the golf ball landing squarely on the back of Hillary s head, sending her flying into the cockpit of the plane she s boarding. While Hillary s trip into the cockpit is real, (probably a result of too much chardonnay that she s always bragging about drinking), Trump hitting her in the back of the head with his golf ball is obviously not real.Watch:Donald Trump's amazing golf swing #CrookedHillary pic.twitter.com/vKhxxFCBV1  Mike (@Fuctupmind) September 14, 2017Sadly, the left continues to prove that they re just a bunch of crybabies and delicate snowflakes who clearly can t take a joke.

BREAKING BOMBSHELL: WEINER IS COOPERATING…FBI Didn’t Need Warrant…NOT Good News For Crooked Hillary [VIDEO],"One can only imagine what kind of relationship Hillary has with her very close top aide s soon to be ex-husband Fox News Sunday reported this morning that Anthony Weiner is cooperating with the FBI, which has re-opened (yes, lefties:  re-opened ) the investigation into Hillary Clinton s classified emails. Watch as Chris Wallace reports the breaking news during the panel segment near the end of the show:https://youtu.be/x13hBwS9q2cAnd the news is breaking while we re on the air. Our colleague Bret Baier has just sent us an e-mail saying he has two sources who say that Anthony Weiner, who also had co-ownership of that laptop with his estranged wife Huma Abedin, is cooperating with the FBI investigation, had given them the laptop, so therefore they didn t need a warrant to get in to see the contents of said laptop. Pretty interesting development. Targets of federal investigations will often cooperate, hoping that they will get consideration from a judge at sentencing. Given Weiner s well-known penchant for lying, it s hard to believe that a prosecutor would give Weiner a deal based on an agreement to testify, unless his testimony were very strongly corroborated by hard evidence. But cooperation can take many forms   and, as Wallace indicated on this morning s show, one of those forms could be signing a consent form to allow investigators to review the contents of devices that they could probably get a warrant for anyway. We ll see if Weiner s cooperation extends beyond that.Via: Red State"
 It’s About Time! Twitter Just Kicked Off A Bunch Of Alt-Right Accounts For Hate Speech,"Twitter has finally decided to take action against the white supremacists running rampant on the social media platform. The same day the company vowed to take a stronger stance against hate speech, they suspended numerous alt-right accounts.Richard Spencer was one of those who was suspended. He runs the National Policy Institute, an alt-right think tank, and  has said he wants blacks, Asians, Hispanics and Jews removed from the U.S.  On Tuesday, Twitter removed his personal verified account, the account for the National Policy Institute, and his online magazine.Naturally, Spencer is losing his shit. USA Today reports: This is corporate Stalinism,  Spencer told The Daily Caller News Foundation. In a YouTube video, entitled Knight of the Long Knives, an apparent reference to the purge of Nazi leaders in 1934 to consolidate Adolf Hitler s power, Spencer said Twitter had engaged in a coordinated effort to wipe out alt-right Twitter. I am alive physically but digitally speaking there has been execution squads across the alt right,  he said.  There is a great purge going on and they are purging people based on their views. Paul Town, Pax Dickinson, Ricky Vaughn and John Rivers were also banished by the Twitter gods.Heidi Beirich, spokeswoman for the Southern Poverty Law Center, said the organization had contacted the social media platform and asked that more than 100 white supremacists  accounts be removed for their incessant hate speech, which clearly violates Twitter s terms of service. They have done nothing,  Beirich said on Monday. It appears that on Tuesday, Twitter finally decided to do something.Beirich also pointed out that two of the alt-right accounts, including Spencer s, had been  verified.  This means Twitter has decided it is  an account of public interest. Twitter has stood up against the vitriol of the alt-right before, but this is the first time they have purged so many accounts in one fell swoop.Featured image via CS Monitor"
CNN INTERVIEW TURNS INTO SCREAMING MATCH When Activist Director Argues New “IRRELEVANT” Footage Of Michael Brown Is Game Changer [VIDEO],"(From CNN) New video captured hours before Michael Brown was killed shows the 18-year-old exchanging marijuana for cigarillos with the clerks of a Ferguson, Missouri, store, a documentary director told CNN on Monday.Director Jason Pollock, whose film  Stranger Fruit  debuted at the South by Southwest festival in Austin over the weekend, said the video shows that Brown did not rob the store before being stopped by police and that surveillance footage purporting to show Brown engaged in a robbery at the Ferguson Market and Liquor stores was actually video of Brown returning to the store to retrieve the cigarillos the clerks gave him. This is a shady store. We ve asked a lot of people in this community. You can buy weed at the store,  Pollock said. Pollock suggests that had this footage been released, it would ve altered the notion that Brown was shot after robbing the store. He learned of the footage from a St. Louis County police report that mentioned a video from 1:13 a.m. the day of Brown s death.In an earlier interview, in which he appeared alongside Brown s father, Pollock said,  What this video shows is that (police) lied to the world about what happened. They wanted to make Mike look bad, so they put out half a video to destroy his character in his death. Police say the new footage is irrelevant to their investigation. Investigators have previously said Officer Darren Wilson initially stopped Brown for walking in the street, not because the store reported a robbery.Watch CNN s explosive interview here:About 100 protesters gathered at the store Sunday night, forcing it to close, and gunshots were heard before midnight, but no one appeared to be injured, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.Gunfire erupted last night in front of the Ferguson store where Michael Brown was captured on surveillance video shoving the store clerk around, and now seen exchanging marijuana, as rioters gear up for a new fight in Ferguson.

 Trump’s Friend Snaps Pic With Guy Holding ‘Nuclear Football’ And Identifies Him On Facebook (SCREENSHOTS),"One of the guests at what Trump calls the  Winter White House    his private business in Florida  really got to feel the privilege associated with being able to drop $200,000 on a membership fee to gain access to the President on Saturday. Guests were treated to quite a bit of excitement when a call came in that North Korea had launched a missile and Trump read over confidential documents in full view of everyone as his white supremacist staffers held their cell phones  flashlights on it so he could see properly at the dinner table.Richard DeAgazio, one of the rich guests who somehow gets access to the President simply by paying him money, posted about watching Trump deal with the North Korea news   complete with photos of Trump reviewing information that is supposed to be secure.But that s not all DeAgazio posted! He also snapped a photo with the guy whose job it is to carry the  nuclear football.  Now the existence of the  football  is, of course, not a national secret. Hillary Clinton, for example, warned us that it is dangerous to place something so dangerous in Donald Trump s care. But DeAgazio made sure our enemies know who has it, what he looks like, and what his name is. This is Rick He carries the  football  The nuclear football (also known as the atomic football, the President s emergency satchel, the Presidential Emergency Satchel, the button, the black box, or just the football) is a briefcase, the contents of which are to be used by the President of the United States to authorize a nuclear attack while away from fixed command centers, such as the White House Situation Room,  he posted on Facebook along with a photo of Rick, whom he says is the Man. All it costs is $200,000 and literally anyone is able to get within inches of access to our nuclear secrets   an interesting fact given The Donald s constant stream of attacks on Hillary Clinton simply for using a private email server. This, of course, is a small matter when compared to Trump s friends exposing details related to our national secrets on social media in real time.I never want to hear about emails again. On the plus, we finally figured out what it takes for one of Trump s rich white buddies to be willing to touch a black man.Featured image via Facebook"
 White Nationalist Radio: Trump Gave Us A Press Pass And We Interviewed His Son,"The hosts of a racist, white nationalist radio show say that they were given official press credentials by Donald Trump s presidential campaign. Even worse, the show says that they were given access to Donald Trump, Jr. and recorded a 20 minute interview with him.The program is called  The Political Cesspool,  and has a considerable history and record of promoting white supremacist ideas and concepts.Political Cesspool radio host James Edwards wrote on his blog that he attended a Donald Trump rally in Memphis on Saturday night as a fully credentialed member of the media and enjoyed the unique experience of being able to air a live broadcast of The Political Cesspool Radio Program from inside the press pen while the event was in full swing. The host said that the interview with the younger Trump will be posted on their website on Saturday.He also bragged that Trump is the first Republican nominee he plans to vote for. After getting an official press pass, the white nationalists were given access to the press area of Trump s campaign rally. Edwards wrote,  After getting my start in politics with Pat Buchanan in 2000, Donald Trump will be the first Republican nominee that I have ever voted for. Buchanan was a man ahead of the times and Trump is his vindicator. Pat Buchanan is of course the former Nixon operative and NBC contributor who has written books excusing the Holocaust and praising Hitler.The Political Cesspool radio show has in the past argued that  interracial sex is white genocide  and  slavery is the greatest thing that ever happened to  black people.Trump recently triggered a national outcry by refusing to disavow or deny an endorsement from white nationalist and former Ku Klux Klansman David Duke in an interview with CNN host Jake Tapper. After being slammed for the failure to distance himself from a notorious racist, Trump concocted the claim that he was having problems with his earpiece and didn t hear the question.He made no such indication during the interview, and in fact repeated the terms  David Duke  and  white supremacist.

 WATCH: Lewis Black Hilariously BURNS Trump And Mocks Inauguration On The Daily Show,"If Lewis Black really does have a ticket to the inauguration, Donald Trump is probably trying to revoke it right now.Because during Wednesday night s Daily Show, the comedian roasted Trump, taking particular aim at Trump s inauguration problems.For weeks, Trump and his team have been desperately trying to find an A-list celebrity to perform at the inauguration. For the most part, Trump has failed, so he has resorted to hiring a reality show contestant and a has-been band, while forcing the Radio City Rockettes to perform because they can be fired for saying no.Black informed Trump that if he wants to know why many celebrities died in 2016, it s because they didn t want to perform at the inauguration either. You want to know why so many celebrities died in 2016? It was to get out of playing the goddamn inauguration,  Black quipped.Then Black pointed out that Trump is pretending he doesn t really care if A-list celebrities show up, even going so far as to claim that he s the one who rejected them and not the other way around.The so-called  A  list celebrities are all wanting tixs to the inauguration, but look what they did for Hillary, NOTHING. I want the PEOPLE!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 23, 2016Black was able to get a ticket, however, and he intends to show up on Friday whether Trump likes it or not. I ve got my tickets, and I m going to go no matter what,  Black said.  Because I want to be there when Trump touches the Bible and his hand catches on fire. Black went on to break the news to Trump that even Richard Nixon was able to land A-list talent for his inaugural ceremony by getting legendary entertainer James Brown to sing. All Trump has been able to get so far is Jackie Evancho, who didn t even win America s Got Talent.To make matters worse, Trump s team literally humiliated themselves by bragging about the participation of the Caisson Platoon and the famous army horse Black Jack. The problem is that Black Jack has been dead since 1976. Trump is  tweeting a dead horse,  Black quipped.Black then revealed Trump s inauguration them is  soft sensuality  which Black says is good because at least Trump is going to f*ck America  gently. Here s the video via YouTube.With an embarrassment like Trump in office, comedians like Lewis Black are definitely going to have plenty of material over the next four years.Featured Image: Screenshot"
"UNREAL! REPUBLICAN SENATE CONFIRMS ERIC HOLDER IN A SKIRT: ANTI-GUN, PRO-ILLEGAL, RADICAL RACIST WHO BELIEVES IN THE MURDER OF ABORTED BABIES BORN ALIVE","LISTEN TO THIS WOMEN SPEAK OF VOTING RIGHTS LIKE IT S 1960. WE DO NOT HAVE A VOTING RIGHTS PROBLEM.  LYNCH THEN SPEAKS ABOUT GOING INTO THE SCHOOLS AND CHANGING THE DISCIPLINE FOR MINORITIES VS WHITES   SHE S THE ONE WHO DECIDED THE MINORITIES NEEDED TO HAVE LESS PUNISHMENT SIMPLY BECAUSE THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN. UNREAL! A Republican-controlled U.S. Senate voted to confirm an attorney general today who says that illegal aliens have a right to work in the United States but that partially born babies do not have a right to life.The Senate took two votes on the nomination of Loretta Lynch: first, a  cloture  vote to end debate and allow a final vote on confirmation, and, then, the final vote itself.Neither of these votes would have taken place had not Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell not brought her nomination to the floor for consideration. Thanks to a change in the interpretation of Senate Rule XXII that he Democratic leadership pushed through in 2013, only 50 votes (as opposed the historical 60) was needed to invoke cloture and end debate on the nomination. In fact, 66 senators voted for cloture including 20 Republicans.Lynch, who has been serving as U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of New York, then won confirmation as attorney general of the United States by a vote of 56 to 43. Nine Senate Republicans voted to confirm her.At a confirmation hearing in January, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R.-Ala.) asked Lynch:  Who has more right to a job in this country? A lawful immigrant who s here, a green-card holder, or a citizen, or a person who entered this country unlawfully? Well, Senator,  said Lynch,  I believe that the right and the obligation to work is one that s shared by everyone in this country regardless of how they came here. And certainly, if someone s here, regardless of status, I would prefer that they be participating in the workplace than not participating in the workplace. Under the laws of the United States, which as attorney general Lynch will be responsible for enforcing, foreign nationals illegally present in the United States are not permitted to work here.In 2006, Lynch joined with a group of fellow former U.S. attorneys in signing an amicus brief submitted to the Supreme Court in the case of Gonzales v. Carhart, which sought to overturn the law that Congress enacted in 2003 that bans partial-birth abortion in the United States. Arguing that the ban should be overturned and partial-birth abortions permitted Lynch and her fellow former U.S. attorneys said that the language of the law, including the term  living fetus,  was too vague to be properly understood by those responsible for obeying it and enforcing it. Furthermore,  said the brief Lynch signed,  the ban s specific provisions, such as the phrase  living fetus,  are hopelessly vague as a legal proscription. It is unclear,  she and the others said,  whether a  living fetus  must be intact. A physician or prosecutor could not possibly know whether a given  overt act   kill -ed the fetus under the ban without having a clear definition of  living,'  wrote Lynch and her fellow defenders of legalized partial-birth abortion.In a 5-4 decision written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, the court rejected the argument that Lynch had made.  The act is not vague,  said the court.In its opinion, the court quoted the description of a partial-birth abortion given by a nurse who assisted in one.The doctor, said this nurse (according to the U.S. Supreme Court),  went in with forceps and grabbed the baby s legs and pulled them down into the birth canal. Then he delivered the baby s body and the arms everything but the head. The doctor kept the head inside the uterus. The baby s little fingers were clasping and unclasping, and his little feet were kicking,  said the nurse.  Then the doctor stuck the scissors in the back of his head, and the baby s arms jerked out, like a startle reaction, like a flinch, like a baby does when he thinks he is going to fall. The doctor opened up the scissors, stuck a high-powered suction tube into the opening, and sucked the baby s brains out,  said the nurse.  Not the baby went completely limp. He cut the umbilical cord,  the nurse said of the doctor who had just sucked out the baby s brains.  He threw the baby in a pan, along with the placenta and the instruments he had just used. At her confirmation hearing, Lynch affirmed that she had signed on to the amicus brief opposing the ban on partial-birth abortion, and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R.-S.C.) told her that that did not disqualify her from serving as attorney general. In 2006, you signed an amicus brief supporting Planned Parenthood s opposition to [the] partial-birth abortion ban. Is that correct?  asked Graham. Yes,  said Lynch.  I was one of a number of former Justice Department officials [who signed it]. Although, the amicus brief that we signed was focused on the issue of the facial issues of the law, and how it might impact the perception of law enforcement s discretion and independence,  she said. The only reason I mentioned that,  said Graham,  is that if there s a Republican president in the future, an attorney general nominee takes an opposite view on an issue like abortion, I hope our friends on the other side will acknowledge it s OK to be an advocate for a cause, as their lawyer. That doesn t disqualify you from serving. The 20 Republicans who voted to move forward on a vote with Lynch s nomination by voting for cloture included: Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Richard Burr of North Carolina, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Thad Cochran of Mississippi, Susan Collins of Maine, Bob Corker of Tennessee, John Cornyn of Texas, Jeff Flake of Arizona, Cory Gardner of Colorado, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Orrin Hatch of Utah, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Mark Kirk of Illinois, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Rob Portman of Ohio, Pat Roberts of Kansas, Rounds of Kansas, John Thune of South Dakota, and Thom Tillis of North Carolina.In the 56 to 43 confirmation vote, 10 Republicans voted for Lynch. They included: Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Thad Cochran of Mississippi, Susan Collins of Maine, Jeff Flake of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Orrin Hatch of Utah, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Mark Kirk of Illinois, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, and Rob Portman of Ohio.Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas opposed the confirmation of Lynch, spoke against her confirmation on the Senate floor, and voted against cloture. But then he did not cast a vote on her final confirmation. His office did not immediately respond to inquiries about why he did not vote.Via: CNS"
 Biographer Says Trump Might Not Actually Be A Billionaire: ‘He Just Makes It Up’ (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s lies are catching up to him one by one, and the latest person to call him out is Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and biographer David Cay Johnston.Some of you may not know who Johnston is, but he is the author behind The Making of Donald Trump   so he knows quite a bit about who the erratic business mogul is and isn t. In a newly released video, Johnston claims that there is absolutely no proof that Trump is the billionaire he says he is   adding another layer of deceit and fraud to Trump s already horrendous track record.The clip was published by Business Insider, where Johnston goes through Trump s bragging claims and compares them to the actual data on the business mogul s court records and bank filings. For example, Johnston says that last year, Trump said his net worth was $8.7 billion, $10 billion, $11 billion and higher,  even though there was nothing going on in the economy that would suggest that kind of gyrations of net worth.  The truth is, Trump is lying though his teeth. Johnston said: The fact of the matter is that Donald Trump just makes it up. Johnston also brought up a court testimony where Trump said he uses his gut  feelings  and  emotional state  to determine his net worth. Johnston joked about how  nuts  it was, and imitated Trump s strategy: By the way, I m having a great day today. I think my net worth must be at least a billion dollars. Johnston has been trying to get America to believe that Trump s billionaire status was fake since 1990. During that time, a net worth statement by Trump s bankers said that the GOP nominee s net worth was actually negative $295 million.Johnston is still standing by the claim that Trump isn t as successful as he seems, and continues to insist that although Trump is well off, there is  no evidence that he is a billionaire.

NY Teacher Gives Assignment To High School Kids: Come Up With Argument In Favor Of Mass Killings Of Jews,"A pair of high school students who take classes at SUNY Oswego via a specialized program are upset at an assignment their  Principles of Literary Representation  class received: Defend Hitler s Final Solution.CiTi/BOCES New Vision program teacher Michael DeNobile handed out a  Top Secret memorandum  to the class  addressed to senior Nazi party members.  It asked students  to put themselves in the shoes of Adolf Hitler s top aides,  according to a report at Syracuse.com.Students Archer Shurtliff and Jordan April, who ended up on opposite sides of the, er,  debate  wondered: Does DeNobile really want students to argue in favor of  the Nazis  justification for genocide? Although the lesson does tell students it is  not for you to be sympathetic to the Nazi point of view,  and is just  an exercise on expanding your point of view,  Shurtliff and April allege it created a rather intolerant atmosphere.One student did a Nazi salute in class, they say, and another said he wished he d been assigned the pro-Holocaust side  because Heil Hitler, duh. From the story:The students brought their concerns over the assignment to DeNobile, administrators in the New Vision program and educators at their home schools.The classroom assignment took them on a mission: To make sure no other student would be asked to argue in favor of killing Jews again.They carefully documented each meeting and conversation with their teachers. They researched other cases, including one in which a teacher was disciplined.They came up with dozens of alternate assignments and materials that didn t force kids to argue on behalf of mass killings. They contacted the Anti-Defamation League, which advocates for Jews.Within a few days, an alternative assignment was offered. Jordan wrote about America s AIDS crisis and response. Archer wrote about the internment of Japanese-Americans and compensation paid to survivors.The students said they weren t satisfied with the administration s response.They are calling for an apology, for the program to retract the assignment completely, and agree to never give it again.Despite the alternative assignment offered, many chose to stick with the original.Archer and Jordan say DeNobile and administrators defended the assignment, claiming they were told  the essay was a lesson in having to do things you don t like, and in seeing the other side of an argument. But Shurtliff shoots down this rationalization rather easily:  It s settled opinion. You can t say that Jews deserve to die. It should be a settled thing. In a letter to New Vision officials, Anti-Defamation League Education Director Beth Martinez wroteThere is no assignment that could ever be given to students that even hints at their [sic] being  two sides  to the  Final Solution /Holocaust that would be pedagogically or morally sound, and we are very disturbed that students are reportedly being asked to be a part of this.Indeed, the assignment says the objective is for students to go  outside [their] comfort zone  and to train their brains  to logistically find the evidence necessary to prove a point. High schoolers   vouching for the annihilation of an entire people is   merely going  outside their comfort zone ? Lovely.For entire story: College Fix"
"NORWAY’S TOUGH Immigration Minister BLASTS Sweden, WARNS Refugees: “If You Are An Economic Migrant” or an “Illegal Immigrant” You’ll Be Sent Home","Norway has a new immigration sheriff in town, and so far, it appears that she s singing the same tune as President Trump on immigration. And oh yeah, Sylvi Listhaug  doesn t give a damn  about her critics either. How far are bleeding-heart nations, like Sweden, France, the UK, and Germany willing to take this mass-immigration experiment, before they realize it s too late to turn back? Before her appointment to the cabinet on December 16, Listhaug, then agriculture minister, criticized what she called a  tyranny of kindness that is blowing over Norwegian society like a nightmare. It is very serious that politicians are using punitive measures that would make it more difficult for a number of asylum seekers who are entitled to protection,  asylum association spokesman Andreas Furuseth told the Norwegian news agency NTB.Listhaug said she wanted 40 or so major and minor asylum law changes submitted to parliament in February before the European spring season, when asylum seeker arrivals were expected to rise again.She told Norwegian NRK public television that her legislative package amounted to a  sharp retrenchment  on wide social entitlements previously granted to refugees.Some 35,000 asylum seekers arrived in Norway in 2015.It was a record for the oil and gas-rich Nordic nation of 5.2 million people, which in recent weeks saw fewer arrivals, in part because of border controls reintroduced in neighboring Sweden and the arrival of wintry weather.NRK said the proposed rule tightening would allow family reunifications only after the applicant had acquired four years of work or education in Norway.And, the government would issue voucher cards instead of cash for day-to-day items to prevent applicants from sending money to family back home.Migrants who arrived on transit visas via Russia would not be granted asylum.Older applicants in the 55 to 67 age group would be required to learn the Norwegian language and aspects of Norwegian society.Applicants who fail to present identity documents will be refused asylum. A grant of temporary residence would not automatically lead to permanent residence.  DWWhen Angela Merkel invited refugees to Germany in 2015, tearing up the rules obliging migrants to seek asylum in the first country they arrive in, the consequences were pretty immediate. Over 160,000 went to Sweden, leading to well-publicised disruption. Next door, things were different. Norway took in just 30,000; this year it has accepted just 2,000 so far. To Sylvi Listhaug, the country s young immigration minister, this might still be a bit too much. We have a big challenge now to integrate those with permission to stay in Norway to make sure they respect Norwegian values,  she says.  Freedom to speak, to write, to believe or not to believe in a god, how to raise your children.  Also, she says, what not to do. For example:  It is not allowed to beat your children in Norway. It s unusual for a European government minister to link immigration with child-beating, but the 39-year-old Ms Listhaug is accustomed to speaking plainly. The rest of Europe, she believes, is coming around to the Norwegian position.After decades in opposition, her Progress Party entered government four years ago, a junior partner in a Conservative-run coalition. Her party envisaged the problems of mass migration in the 1980s, she says, so was well ahead of the populist upstarts now haunting so much of Europe.  A lot of them are socialist parties but against immigration. We are a libertarian party. We want less government, so people should decide more over their own life. And we want a stricter immigration policy because that s important for Norway in the long run. While Sweden and others saw the migration of 2015 as a blip caused by conflict in Syria and Iraq, she sees it as part of an irreversible demographic trend.  Africa is going to gain almost 500 million more people by 2030,  she says.  Much of the Middle East and Africa is fragile. People have difficult lives but can see via mobile phones that life in the West and in Europe is quite different. So I understand why they would like our life, our kind of standards. But it s not sustainable to integrate so many. Why not? Norway, with its oil-generated trillion-dollar sovereign wealth fund, is one of the world s richest countries   and hardly beset by integration issues. This, she says, is because they ve been careful.  Many of the jobs here today perhaps will not be here tomorrow. Working in supermarkets for example   those kinds of jobs that don t need higher education. Those who come to Norway without any education   what are they going to do in the future if this continues? The case for limiting economic migration is clear. But about half of the registered asylum seekers in the EU, last year were from countries that were struck by conflict. Can Norway justify taking so few? Ms. Listhaug is a practicing Christian (albeit skeptical of the  thoroughly socialist  Church of Norway) and says her government s immigration policy, when combined with its aid policy, is not just a moral response, but the most effective moral response. For me it s a moral issue as well. You can t just help the ones you see. You have to think about the millions you don t see and that have a very difficult life in the world. She s referring to the refugee camps in Jordan, where both Norway and the UK send aid to help those displaced by war. Norway gave  23 million to its Jordanian mission last year, almost twice as much, per capita, as Britain. The cost of helping refugees at home is taken from its foreign aid budget, so as its influx subsides and costs fall, all savings are used to help refugees abroad. Some  370 million has been transferred so far, with more expected next year.So to Ms. Listhaug, it s not a question of whether to help refugees, but how best to do so. We meet after she visited Brandon Lewis, her British counterpart, who gave her a striking statistic:  The immigration minister here in Britain said that for the price of helping 3,000 young people here, he could help 100,000 children in other parts of the world. She sees this as a modern way to help asylum seekers   and more practical than the 1951 UN Refugee Convention, which obliges signatories to accommodate anyone with a  well-founded fear of persecution . It was an agreement for its time,  she says.  But when people travel through 20 countries to come to a safe haven, I think people can see that this is not right. You could have a safe haven in your neighboring country, so why go so far? Western countries that define their virtue by the number of refugees they let in, she says, also face a moral question:  Why should we have a system that works for the people who have money [to pay for the journey] while the rest of the refugees and people in need don t have the money to go? People traffickers, she says, thrive on governments that follow the old rules and accept those who turn up on their shores.  If you smuggle an unaccompanied minor from Afghanistan to Europe, they say it is between $3,000 and $20,000.  Young girls, she says, are sometimes sold to old men to finance such a journey.  Also, children are killed, or raped, on their way. So we need to have this under control. Ms Listhaug provoked fury in Sweden a few weeks ago by visiting a suburb in Stockholm notorious for unrest among its young immigrant population. She called it a  no-go zone    a phrase that the Swedes angrily reject. But she doesn t seem to mind causing a fuss, especially as she thinks her critics are coming around to her way of thinking. Nor does she mind using Sweden as a case study in what not to do.  A lot of countries in Europe are thinking more like us: like Denmark and Austria. Germany, as well  France has big problems right now with integration, as does Belgium. A lot of countries in Europe see that we need to have this under control. The Norwegian model, she says, is very different and very clear.  If you are an economic migrant, you are declined in Norway,  she says.  We send people back to Afghanistan if they are not in need of protection; we send them back to Somalia if they are not in need of protection.  Isn t this a rather expensive process?  Yes, but it s well worth it.  Police are also sent out to areas where illegal immigrants are suspected of living and working.  If we find them, we send them out. That has also decreased crime in Norway, that s very good. I ask Listhaug if she is getting used to being called cruel and heartless. How does it make her feel? Her response comes quickly:  I don t give a damn,  she says. She thinks her approach is right, and the consensus is wrong. And, as she says, an increasing number of other countries think the same. A new consensus might well be in the making.  SpectatorUKSo what do her neighbors in Sweden think of her tough positions on asylum seekers? The Swedish resident in the video below has nothing but praise for Listhaug. He openly praises her while mocking the  lefties  who have allowed out-of-control migration to destroy much of Sweden. In the video below, he reminds Swedes of the startling crime statistics they are facing: In Sweden, we have 10 times more car torchings. Do you want this? We have 4 times more violent killings than Norway. Is that what you want? Well, you should listen to your lefties, and be more like Sweden, It s interesting, the migration minister Sylvi Listhaug, came to Sweden to find out for herself, she wanted to find out what not to do in Norway.

RACE BAITING LIBERALS WILL HATE TRUMP’S CHOICE To Lead Domestic Transition Team,"Ken Blackwell, the Ohio Republican selected by President-Elect Donald Trump to lead his domestic issues transition is an outspoken conservative with a history as a party maverick.Blackwell, according to a document obtained by Politico, is in charge of the Trump  action team  examining the departments of energy, environmental protection, labor, transportation, health and human services, housing and urban development, interior and agriculture.Blackwell backed Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in the Republican primaries, but came aboard with Trump after he secured the nomination.Reached by The Cincinnati Enquirer, Blackwell said he could not discuss his duties because he had signed a non-disclosure agreement.Blackwell is familiar to Ohioans. He prevailed in an intra-party feud in 2006 to become Ohio s first black nominee for governor, but then lost in a lopsided race with Democrat Ted Strickland.He also took on fellow Republicans in the state Legislature while serving as secretary of state from 1999 to 2007. He also was state treasurer from 1994 to 1999.As chief elections officer, Blackwell played a pivotal role in administering the hotly-contested 2004 presidential election while serving as Republican George W. Bush s honorary campaign co-chair. Democrats alleged in political attacks and lawsuits that Blackwell supported vote-suppressing policies favoring Bush, who won the state and the election.Blackwell, a former Cincinnati mayor, is on the boards of the National Rifle Association and Club for Growth. He s also a senior fellow at the Family Research Council.Via: Dispatch"
RECKLESS DEM MAYOR BLAMES AMTRAK ENGINEER FOR CRASH…UPDATE: New Evidence Shows Train May Have Been Hit By Projectile,"Perhaps Democrat Mayor Michael Nutter is taking a cue from the reckless DA in Baltimore in presuming guilt of the engineer without the benefit of an investigation. The Mayor basically accused the engineer of criminal negligence without even knowing all of the details of the crash. From Democrat Mayor Michael Nutter:  Clearly it was reckless in terms of the driving by the engineer. There s no way in the world that he should have been going that fast into the curve. Clearly he was reckless and irresponsible in his actions. There s really no excuse that can be offered. Listen to the Mayor s unjustified, irresponsible inflammatory remarks here:https://youtu.be/CBZxmmdp2Kg The Amtrak train that derailed Tuesday, killing eight people and injuring more than 200, may have been struck by an object before it careened off the tracks, an assistant conductor on the train told investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board.At a news conference on Friday, Robert L. Sumwalt, the safety board official who is leading the investigation, said an assistant conductor had reported that she believed she heard a radio transmission in which an engineer on a regional line said his train had been struck by a projectile and the engineer on the Amtrak train replied that his had been struck, too.Mr. Sumwalt said that investigators had found a fist-size circular area of impact on the left side of the Amtrak train s windshield and that they had asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation to analyze it. He said that the F.B.I. had been called in because it has the forensics expertise needed for the investigation, but that it had not yet begun its analysis.He said that investigators had also interviewed the engineer and found him  extremely cooperative,  and that the engineer had said he was not fatigued or ill at the time of the accident. But he could not remember anything about the derailment.Investigators asked the engineer, Brandon Bostian, whether he recalled any projectiles, and he said he did not. He was specifically asked that question, and he did not recall anything of that sort,  Mr. Sumwalt said.  But then again, he reported that he does not have any recollection of anything past North Philadelphia. The assistant conductor, however, who was working in the cafe car, heard Mr. Bostian talking to an engineer on the Septa regional rail line who said his train had been  hit by a rock or shot at,  according to Mr. Sumwalt. She said she thought she heard Mr. Bostian reply that his train had also been struck. Right after she recalled hearing this conversation between her engineer and the Septa engineer, she said she felt a rumbling, and her train leaned over and her car went over on its side,  Mr. Sumwalt said.Jerri Williams, a spokeswoman at Septa, confirmed that the windshield of one of its trains had been shattered by a projectile near the North Philadelphia station about 9:10 p.m. on Tuesday, about 12 minutes before the Amtrak train derailed. We have reports of trains  being struck by objects in this area about two to three times a month,  Ms. Williams said. Mostly, she said, the objects are thrown by children and do no damage.The safety board has asked to interview the engineer of the Septa train that was hit by the projectile, and Septa is cooperating, Ms. Williams said.For days, speculation about the cause of the accident has centered on Mr. Bostian. Investigators reported earlier this week that the train accelerated suddenly a minute before the derailment and that Mr. Bostian applied the emergency brake seconds before the cars careened off the tracks, striking nearby utility poles.On Friday, Mr. Sumwalt said that the engineer, accompanied by his lawyer, had been open with investigators and had demonstrated a  very good working knowledge  of the proper procedures and speeds for the rail line, but that he did not remember the accident. He recalls ringing the train bell as he went through North Philadelphia Station, as required,  Mr. Sumwalt said.  He has no recollection of anything past that. Investigators said that Mr. Bostian had been  extremely  cooperative during his interview and that he had  reported no problems with his train handling. Two other conductors were on the train that night. A senior conductor is hospitalized, according to the safety board, and has not been interviewed.A junior conductor was in the back of the train and reported that his radio was not working, so he was unable to hear the engineer, Mr. Sumwalt said. He told investigators he felt shaking, then two large impacts that dislodged seats.Both conductors said they had confidence in the engineer, calling him  very professional. Via: NYT"

Kerry’s Lunacy: ‘US Would Be Justified Shooting Down Unarmed Russian Jets’,"21st Century Wire says As 21WIRE reported yesterday, imperial bureaucrats in Washington and their court scribes in the mainstream media propaganda industry   continue the charade of the Roman mindset, believing that the US has eminent domain over the entire planet and all must kneel in the presence of old glory.It s statements like this that indicate how with each passing day, NATO is fast becoming a defunct organization.As he hopelessly clings to his outdated Cold War script, Bonesman and US Secretary of State John Kerry continues to be completely detached from reality  Jason Ditz Antiwar.comUS officials are still on about yesterday s incident, in which a pair of unarmed Russian jets flew within 30 feet of a US destroyer in the Baltic Sea, something US officials described as a  simulated attack  that proved Russia s  unprofessional  nature.Today, Secretary of State John Kerry declared the flights  provocative  and insisted the USS Donald Cook would ve been well within its rights to shoot down the planes under the  rules of engagement  they are placed under.Which is a stunning claim, since the USS Donald Cook is deployed in the peaceful Baltic, off the coast of the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, and the US and Russia are not at war. That they have rules of engagement allowing them to unilaterally attack Russian aircraft at all seems unwise.Russian Major General Igor Konashenkov says he is  baffled  by the US reaction, saying the Russian jets were operating well within their safety guidelines, and that the US freedom of navigation near a Russian naval base  does not at all cancel the principle of freedom of flight for Russian aircraft.

JIM BEAM Fans Call For Boycott After Spokesperson and Liberal Actress Brags About Taunting VP Mike Pence For Defending Life,"The decision of actress Mila Kunis to make monthly donations to abortion business Planned Parenthood in pro-life Vice President Mike Pence s name has generated a call for a boycott of Jim Beam on Twitter.Jim Beam global brand spokesperson Kunis told Conan O Brien Thursday that she donates to Planned Parenthood in Pence s name to protest his pro-life policies. O Brien asked Kunis to explain her  prank: I apologize if I m offending anybody. It s not so much a prank as much as I disagreed with some of the stuff that Pence was doing and was trying to do. And so as a reminder that there are women out there in the world that may or may not agree with his platform, I put him on a list of recurring donations that are made in his name to Planned Parenthood.Every month, to his office, he gets a little letter that says like,  An anonymous donation has been made in your name.  I don t look at it as a prank, this is like, I strongly disagree, and this is my little way of doing it. It s a peaceful protest.  Breitbart NewsThe new face of Jim Beam, the iconic bourbon brand, might not be quite what you expect. While a rough-around-the-edges cowboy or country rock star might seem to fit the bill Jim Beam has used Kid Rock at times in the past its newest spokesperson is the petite and beautiful Mila Kunis.The 30-year-old actress, who says she is a big fan of bourbon in general, is featured in two new 30-second Beam ads, as well as five other videos ranging in length from 15 seconds to more than three minutes.

 New Republican SCOTUS Tactic: Who Needs 9 Justices Anyway?,"In a desperate bid to normalize the Republican Party s insane stance on keeping Scalia s seat on the Supreme Court empty, a new talking point is being tried out by conservatives: There s no time limit in the Constitution, and there s nothing magical about there being nine justices, [Dean] Reuter said during a panel meeting at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). The country started out with six justices, we ve had as many as ten at some point in time,  he continued.  As recently as 2010, when Justice Elena Kagan came on the Court, she had been solicitor general so she recused herself in over a third of the cases (so) I don t see a sense of urgency. I fully expect this to be repeated over and over again and eventually mimicked by the corporate media. If there s one thing besides crippling America that the GOP is really good at, it s making their sabotage seem perfectly normal. The corporate media is always a willing accomplice to this charade as they will tie themselves into knots to avoid calling out the historic extremism of the right.A side benefit of using this kind of rhetoric to keep the 9th seat empty for so long is that when a Democrat wins in November, they ll already have normalized a reduced Court. It s like stacking the Court, adding seats to dilute the power of one set of Justices, but in reverse.On the flip side, if Republicans were to somehow win in November, I wouldn t be at all surprised if they suddenly  realized  that 9 Justices just aren t enough and we really should have 11, 7 of whom would just happen to be conservative. For a group that calls themselves  conservatives,  ostensibly the party that preserves the status quo, the American right wing has zero interest in preserving tradition, precedent or the Constitution. They re only interested in preserving their own power at any expense.Featured image via Rational Politics"
" Trump TRASHES Sean Spicer’s Cell Phone Checks, Signals Trump Team Implosion (VIDEO)","The Trump team is caving in on itself, and Donald Trump s latest comments certainly won t help.Earlier today, Trump appeared on Fox & Friends where he blatantly criticized White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer. Addressing the mysterious and numerous leaks that have been coming out of the White House, Spicer was reported to be checking the professional and personal cell phones of White House staffers in the West Wing to make sure they weren t involved in leaking any information. It was a drastic move, and we ve never seen such distrust within an administration, and yet Trump still claims everything in the White House is running like a  well-oiled machine.  But something tells us that after Spicer hears what Trump just said, things are going to change.In his exclusive White House interview, Trump admitted that he wouldn t have handled the leaks the way Spicer did. Steve Doocey asked Trump: Sean Spicer asked his communication team,  Alright come on in everybody. Put your phone right over there. We have a leaker here. We re gonna have the White House lawyer look at your phones.  How intent are you on finding who the leaker or leakers are in your administration? Not just your communications team, but over at the State Department, maybe the intel community, everywhere? Trump first bragged about how great his press secretary was (even though there have been several reports that state Trump is unhappy with Spicer s performance and would rather replace him with a woman). He said, Well first of all, Sean Spicer is a fine human being. He s a fine person. Then Trump criticized Spicer: I would have done it differently. I would have gone one-on-one with different people. I would have handled it different than Sean, but Sean handles it his way, and I m OK with it. Hinting that he felt Spicer was going far too easy on staffers, Trump joked that if it were up to him,  there are things you can do that are a hell of a lot worse.

EXPOSE THE LIES: Shut Down Planned Parenthood’s Phone Lines,"TODAY IS  SCHEDULE YOUR MAMMOGRAM DAY  WITH PLANNED PARENTHOOD   PP LIES TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SO WE THINK IT S IMPORTANT TO CALL THEM OUT ON THE FACTS: They DO NOT perform mammograms!Please call your local Planned parenthood clinic and ask if you can schedule your mammogram with them   Do it today! A few years ago, Cecile Richards went on television and said that if Planned Parenthood was defunded, women would lose access to services  such as mammograms.  As a former clinic director of Planned Parenthood, I knew this was simply not true.We scheduled our first  Schedule Your Mammogram Day  after that. We had over 10,000 people call Planned Parenthood. While we were hoping for an official statement from Planned Parenthood, they were silent.Just a couple nights ago at the Miss America pageant, one of the contestants stated that Planned Parenthood shouldn t be defunded because women would lose access to those dang mammograms.We figured maybe it was time to make some more calls. Hey, maybe Planned Parenthood started providing mammograms in house!? It s time to find out.We are asking prolifers everywhere to call your local Planned Parenthood clinics and ask to schedule your mammogram.GOAL: 20,000 calls!WHO CAN CALL? Anyone! If you re a guy   call to schedule one for the lady in your life. WHEN: All day on September 21, 2015 WHERE: Google your local planned parenthood and call  em up. IMPORTANT: AT THE END OF EVERY CALL, MAKE SURE TO TELL THE PLANNED PARENTHOOD WORKER TO GO VISIT WWW.ABORTIONWORKER.COM.We will continue to do this month after month until Planned Parenthood makes an official statement announcing that they do NOT provide mammogram services. It s time to bust this myth once and for all.AT THE END OF EVERY CALL, MAKE SURE TO TELL THE PLANNED PARENTHOOD WORKER TO GO VISIT WWW.ABORTIONWORKER.COM.PLANNED PARENTHOOD IS LYING TO YOU!The big fib that Planned Parenthood leads with, and one that is endlessly repeated by their friends in the media, is that if Planned Parenthood is defunded, where will all those women go for their mammograms? Planned Parenthood CEO Cecile Richards says this wherever she goes.Planned Parenthood does not do mammograms. Lila Rose of LiveAction showed this by having people call dozens of Planned Parenthood facilities asked for a mammogram and being told every single time,  No, we don t do mammograms  and then being directed to a local clinic that does.No one has to take Lila Rose s word for it though, according to a dossier prepared by Americans United for Life,  As recently as 2012, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has confirmed that no Planned Parenthood clinic is authorized to perform mammograms.

 The Internet Perfectly HUMILIATES Racist Breitbart For Boycotting Kellogg’s,"If you ever wondered what racist conservatives would like to eat for breakfast, Twitter has the answer.White nationalist website Breitbart is throwing a hissy fit because Kellogg s pulled advertising from the site to  ensure our ads do not appear on sites that aren t aligned with our values as set forth in our advertising guidelines. In other words, the cereal maker does not want their company associated with a racist sexist publication that spews hateful right-wing propaganda.And they can t be blamed for that. After all, companies like Kellogg s want to sell their products to as diverse a consumer base as possible and giving a racist company like Breitbart adverting dollars only alienates.So Breitbart decided to get revenge by declaring war on Kellogg s and calling for a boycott. You know, because conservative boycotts always work.Yeah, that was sarcasm. In reality, conservative boycotts rarely work. In fact, they are usually mocked relentlessly and humiliated. Breitbart definitely learned that overnight because Twitter users started a new hashtag and #BreitbartCereals has been trending ever since.The Fascist Monster cereals: Count Trumpula and Boo Bannon #BreitbartCereals  Carlos Pecciotto (@EEgreenbunny) December 1, 2016Hooded Bunches of Oafs #BreitbartCereals  Adam Stillman (@Stillyman11) December 1, 2016Children of the Corn Flakes#BreitbartCereals pic.twitter.com/i1RYbOOvBB  Christian Greco (@Jolly_Esquire) December 1, 2016Chex (and Balances are Gone) #BreitbartCereals  Portmanteau Jones (@SadlyCatless) December 1, 2016#BreitbartCereals Frosted Fake News  Michael K.

Kellogg s decision to blacklist one of the largest conservative media outlets in America is economic censorship of mainstream conservative political discourse,  Breitbart whined.  That is as un-American as it gets. Except that it s not un-American at all. Just like Breitbart is exercising their right to be total dicks, Kellogg s is exercising their right to not associate with them. It s called the free market.Despite being humiliated, conservatives are already crowing because Kellogg s stock price coincidentally dropped after Breitbart called for a boycott. So those of us who hate racists should go out and support Kellogg s by buying their cereal and other products to make sure Kellogg s is rewarded for rejecting hate. Because if Breitbart is allowed to successfully bully Kellogg s into supporting them, they ll do it to other companies who also do the right thing.Featured image via Twitter "
BREAKING: Mexico’s President Cancels Visit With Trump Over Defending Our US Border From Lawbreakers…But Wrongfully Imprisoning US Marine Tahmooressi For “Border Violation” Was No Big Deal,"On March 31, 2015 Sergeant Andrew Tahmooressi was driving with his friends to go to a Mexican restaurant and accidentally missed the last exit before the Mexican border. Without the ability to turn around before he crossed the border, he proceeded to the Mexican customs post, where he explained that he missed the exit before the crossing, and volunteered that he had three US legal guns in the vehicle. After that, Sergeant Andrew Tahmooressi was arrested and charged with gun smuggling into Mexico.While we all understand the problem of illicit arms and drug smuggling between Mexico and the US, it is clear that Sergeant Andrew Tahmooressi was not part of it. He made an honest mistake, admitted it to the Mexican border agents, and was arrested anyway. His admission and cooperation with the Mexican authorities strongly attest to his innocent intent.Tahmooressi was released in November when a Mexican judge was finally convinced to do so on humanitarian grounds. His lengthy prison stay became a farce and a failure under the Obama administration, culminating in a September congressional hearing that was  highly critical of Obama Administration efforts to secure his release and Mexico s refusal to let him go. With the swipe of a pen on Wednesday, President Trump green lighted the construction of a border wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and vastly increased the presence of border agents. Mexican President Enrique Pe a Nieto soon expressed regret over the new U.S. leader s actions and pledged to protect Mexicans already in the States. Where there is a Mexican migrant at risk that requires our support, your country should be there,  Pe a Nieto said in a brief address to his nation, which he said was a response to Trump s actions earlier in the day. Our communities are not alone,  Pe a Nieto said.  The Mexican Government will provide them with the legal advice, which guarantees the protection they require.The 50 Mexican consulates in the U.S. will be advocating on behalf of Mexicans, Nieto explained. He added (again) that he does not intend to pay for Trump s border wall. Mexico offers and demands respect as the fully sovereign nation we are,  he insisted.BREAKING: Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto says he has informed the White House he has canceled trip to Washington.  The Associated Press (@AP) January 26, 2017Nieto is apparently so distressed by Trump s executive actions that he is considering canceling their scheduled meeting for next week, where they were due to discuss not only immigration, but trade.Trump said that if Nieto is not willing to pay for the wall, he can go ahead and cancel.

 Samantha Bee Broadcasts American Atheists Trolling CPAC And It Is GLORIOUS (VIDEO),"The Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) is full of hard-right Christians who hate the usual groups of people that we ve all heard of that group hating   most notably, those who do not believe in the Christian god. So, to that end, the last thing they want at that particular event is a group of atheists. However, that is just who showed up to the 2016 edition of CPAC.David Silverman is with what is arguably the largest and most vocal secular group in America   American Atheists. He also ran a booth at CPAC. As you can imagine, this was not a well-received endeavor. However, being one of the most outspoken atheists in America has its advantages, and Full Frontal host Samantha Bee broadcast Silverman s trolling of righteous Christians at CPAC on her show, Full Frontal. What happened can only be described as brilliant comedy gold.Silverman s booth and display included signs with messages such as  keep your theocracy out of my democracy.  Silverman also broadcast his contempt for religion, saying: Religion is a lie. A scam. A con. It has no redeeming values and it has no place in today s society. There were also undeniable statistical facts in the clip that gave the message that refuted the idea that there are no atheists, especially since the number of non religious Americans is at 56,000,000 and growing. It warned believers: Stop saying,  Hey, atheists! Go away! The thing is, we atheists aren t going anywhere; in fact the opposite is true. We are the fastest growing  religious  group   especially among young people, including conservatives. This was evidenced by the fact that young conservatives began approaching Silverman s booth and listening to what he had to say. Silverman even referenced GOP frontrunner Donald Trump as a reason young conservatives are turning away from religion, saying through another animation: The conservative coalition, with its disparate components, has always been a platypus, stitched together with other platypi to create a platy-franken-pus. Now it s rotting at the seams collapsing into a festering pile of platy, frank and pus, feasted on by orange maggots. This oozing and tropic goo might present a nourishing culture medium for the atheists at CPAC, but many were unhappy to see them. The thing is, Silverman is right. Religion in general is quickly dying, especially the extreme conservative variety. The fact that a huge secular presence was at them most conservative event held each year is most ominous indeed for that movement, and great for ours. Good for Samantha Bee for broadcasting this phenomenon, and for David Silverman for bringing it to light.Watch the video below in all its secular glory:Featured image via video screen capture"

 Trump Takes His Voter Fraud Conspiracy To A TERRIFYING New Level,"Donald Trump has been obsessed with the fact that he lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton ever since the election results came in. Not satisfied with the Electoral College victory that handed him the White House, Trump has continued to double and triple down on an insane and unsubstantiated conspiracy theory that massive voter fraud is what cost him the popular vote.Well now, with the power of the presidency behind him, Trump has taken a terrifying step: Saying he will open a  major investigation  into the 2016 election. He also seems to be laying the groundwork for even more voter suppression and disenfranchisement of voters who are least likely to vote for him. He tweeted early Wednesday morning of his plans:I will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and .  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017even, those registered to vote who are dead (and many for a long time). Depending on results, we will strengthen up voting procedures!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017What makes this even more disturbing is that Trump s Attorney General pick, Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions, has a long and storied history of opposing civil rights, and specifically voting rights. This is just a way for Republicans to sow discord and deny facts, and to help assuage Trump s ego by allowing him to make himself feel better in this new world of  alternative facts,  that White House counsel Kellyanne Conway infamously pushed on Sunday.This is dangerous beyond anything we ever could have imagined. We have a conspiracy theorist as president, who also happens to be a narcissistic madman who cannot accept the truth. Even worse, he has people around him who are defending his antics, and who are perfectly willing to lie to the American people about the most trivial of matters. If they ll lie about this, what else will they lie about?This administration is a threat to our democracy. Regardless of political ideology, it has to be concluded that Trump is undermining the fabric of our republic before our very eyes.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images"
HUGE SECURITY LAPSE: International Flight Passengers Skip Customs,"Skipping customs at JFK might seem like a great thing for passengers arriving on an international flight BUT those passengers might be putting all Americans in danger by doing so. For the second time in a few months, a flight into JFK let passengers bypass customs. JFK is known to have a brutal customs time that can be up to two hours but the choice should be obvious just do it: New York remains the number one target for terrorists and it just made me think of Paris and how easy it would be for them to get in,  he said.  It s incompetence like this that could lead to another attack. Passengers arriving at Kennedy Airport on an international flight were allowed to exit the busy hub without going through Customs   for at least the second time in recent months.Bumbling airline and security officials let travelers on American Airlines Flight 1223 from Cancun, Mexico, out of the airport on Monday morning without having their passports or bags checked, sources told The News.The security lapse mirrored a similar incident involving another American Airlines flight in November.A 34-year-old man who had been in Cancun to attend three Phish concerts told The News he was able to glide from the plane to the baggage claim area without having to endure the usual maze of Customs and Border Protection security checks. It s absolutely absurd,  the business adviser said.  To think that anyone could be walking off of that plane and just get right into the city. It could be terrorists, El Chapo s henchmen, anyone. The jam band fan said he even approached a Transportation Security Administration agent near the exit, but was told he was free to go.A man who had been in Cancun to attend three Phish concerts told The News he was able to glide from the plane to the baggage claim area without having to endure Customs and Border Protection security checks.  I told them what happened and asked them what should I do,  the passenger said.  They said to me  That s fine, you re OK. Go ahead.   Several other concertgoers who were on the flight were already outside at the curbside cab line when he exited the airport.Neither the TSA, which screens passengers before they fly, nor the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, part of the Department of Homeland Security, responded to a request for comment.It was unclear how many of the passengers from the flight were able to skip the security checkpointsHours after the plane landed, American Airline officials pleaded with the Manhattan man   and presumably other passengers   to return to Kennedy and complete the customs process. I apologize for any inconvenience this may be for you; however it is a Customs requirement that every passenger entering the United States must clear Customs,  the airline wrote in an email sent to passengers. You could tell that they knew they screwed up and were desperate to get me to come,  the passenger added.The oversight sparked fears that terrorists could easily slip into the country without having to pass through any checkpoints. New York remains the number one target for terrorists and it just made me think of Paris and how easy it would be for them to get in,  he said.  It s incompetence like this that could lead to another attack. A nearly identical incident involving another American Airlines flight from Cancun unfolded in November, just two days after ISIS released a video threatening New York City with a terrorist attack, The News reported.

 Another White Trump Supporter Assaults A Black Man At A Terrifying Rally In The South (VIDEO),"Enough is enough. It s time for Donald Trump to condemn this racist violence or be forced to end his campaign.For the second time in a week, video footage has revealed yet another incident of violent racism at the same Trump rally in North Carolina where an old white redneck sucker-punched a young black protester in the head as he was being escorted out the building by police.78-year-old John McGraw has since been arrested by law enforcement, but now it looks like police are going to have to hunt down and arrest another white racist who assaulted a different black person who, despite not doing anything wrong, was escorted out with other African-American attendees by officers who roughed some of them up for no reason.East Carolina University student Adedayo Adeniyi caught the terrifying experience on his cell phone camera on Wednesday as officers began scuffling with other black people in the stands around him. Hey that s not me, that s them,  Adeniyi says on the video in reference to being told he has to leave even though he wasn t even protesting.  I don t even know them! The cops, who are white, wrestle one protester to the ground and cuff him before leading him off. As Adeniyi is also led off down the aisle, an old white KKK wannabe tells him  Hey, f*ck you, baby, f*ck you!  And then physically assaults him by slapping him, and police didn t seem to care about that at all.Here s the video via YouTube.Afterwards, Adeniyi remarked that the incident made him fear for the future of America because it definitely looks like the country is embracing hate and bigotry. These are presidential candidate rallies,  he told the New York Daily News. I m not at a KKK rally. The fact that I experienced hate at a candidate rally tells you everything you need to know about Donald Trump and the people that support him. People will act more hateful and racist in environments that they feel not only encouraged to do it, but accept it as normal. The man at the end of the video is a moment I ll never forget. The hate in his eyes. The words. The hate in those words. The slap. It was disgusting and sad. At that moment I believed that America will stay and continue to be a hateful and bigoted country. Donald Trump s rallies are nothing more than glorified white supremacist rallies that are an embarrassment to this nation and those around the world. The fact that any candidate for political office here in 21st century America actually condones and encourages violence and racism against black people is sickening The fact that the police are serving as Trump s own personal guard and are allowing these acts of violence to occur and in some cases even joining in is just as disgusting. This is not the America any of us should want, but it s the one we ll get if people do not vote in November.Featured image via Flickr"
" Racist Trump Fan Arrested By FBI For Threat On Obama’s Life, Had Bombs","A racist Donald Trump fan has been arrested by the FBI after he made threats to kill President Obama. The authorities also found that he had a cache of pipe bombs on his property when they raided his home in Oregon.John Martin Roos, a 61-year-old from Oregon, has been charged with communication of a threat in interstate commerce, and additional charges are likely forthcoming. Roos first came onto the federal government s radar after a  concerned citizen  brought Roos  Facebook and Twitter postings to the FBI s attention in February, according to an affidavit from Special Agent Jeffrey Gray.Roos also had a series of Facebook and Twitter posts with racist rants targeting the President. Obama you goat fffing fudgepacker, the refugees are men of fighting age. Black lives matter! Sure we need someone to pick cotton and wash cars. Paris, burn diseased muslim neighborhoods to the ground and start over with human beings. Obama you are on a hit list,  he wrote in a post that appears to have been removed.He is just the latest in a line of people, ranging from the truly dangerous to just out and out cranks, that have been apprehended since Obama s inauguration in 2009 for threats towards the first black president.His postings online definitely took cues from the targets of Donald Trump s ire. The Huffington Post reported that Roos used his online postings to attack  Attorney General Loretta Lynch, singer Beyonce, Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly and reporter Michelle Fields.  Roos also had praise for those who have supported Trump or been praised by the reality TV star:He praised Ann Coulter and Stacey Dash, and posted several links to posts on Breitbart.com.Coulter has identified herself as a Trump supporter, while on Fox News, Dash has defended and promoted Trump.Breitbart.com has been the most pro-Trump of the conservative media outlets, and an insider has actually alleged that Trump has been paying the site for favorable coverage.Featured image via Facebook"
BILL O’REILLY ANNOUNCES 2 Week Vacation…Will Murdoch’s Liberal Son Who Pushed To Fire Roger Ailes Make His Vacation Permanent? [VIDEO],"Embattled Fox News host Bill O Reilly announced on Tuesday that he will be going off the air for almost two weeks, to take a vacation.The anchor s announcement comes amid an ongoing controversy over sexual harassment allegations made against him and a new report that James Murdoch wants him out of the company for good.The exodus of sponsors followed a recent report in The New York Times that five women were paid a total of $13million to keep quiet about harassment allegations.The accusations surrounding O Reilly, which date back 15 years, include claims of dirty phone calls, unwanted kisses and hotel room invites. The assumption is that he ll exit in a non-embarrassing way,  one senior Fox News staffer told the magazine.O Reilly declined to share where he was heading, but has launched an online contest for fans to vote on where they think his vacation destination is. He made the point that the time off was voluntary.Bill O Reilly kept his announcement to leave FOX News for a two-week vacation upbeat:The claims prompted 60 sponsors to drop advertising deals with the prime time show and led to an internal investigation.Four network sources told New York Magazine that it s possible O Reilly s getaway could turn into a permanent vacation.The Murdoch family, the owners of Fox, are reportedly split on what to do about O Reilly. Rupert Murdoch and his eldest son Lachlan are said to be inclined to keep O Reilly, while younger son James   the CEO of 21st Century Fox   wants to give him the boot.James also pushed to fire Roger Ailes amid last summer s sex scandal, and sources think he could be successful in weeding out O Reilly this time around.  Daily MailJames Murdoch is said to have convinced his father, 76, to  go green  in a major May 9 speech. In the speech, Rupert Murdoch sounded like Al Gore, saying that  Climate change poses clear, catastrophic threats  and that  We may not agree on the extent, but we certainly can t afford the risk of inaction. Marc Gunther of Fortune magazine commented that  Murdoch has boldly promised to make News Corp. carbon neutral by 2010 and to weave environmental issues and themes into his newspapers, TV shows, movies and online properties-a tricky business, particularly when it comes to news.  (emphasis added)The Hillary front organization known as Media Matters has challenged Murdoch to rein in the various Fox News personalities, including Hannity, who have voiced skepticism about the man-made global warming theory. The group complains that conservative voices on Fox far outnumber  progressive  voices and that Fox anchors, reporters, and guests inject pro-Republican views into the shows.Murdoch s decision to hand the European and Asian operations of his company to his son James has been widely interpreted as a sign that James will soon inherit control of the entire company. That means that James  liberal philosophy on environmental and other matters could become the party line not only of News Corporation but the Fox News Channel.The New York Times has described James Murdoch as  steadfastly liberal  and notes that he  has supported Bill Clinton and Al Gore whose daughter he befriended at Harvard.

 Trump Accidentally Says He Wants Single Payer In Latest Tweet – Twitter Lets Him Know (TWEETS),"It can easily be said that Donald Trump is a few sandwiches short of a picnic, and he just proved that fact once again with his latest tweet.Trump, since the start of his campaign, has been telling everyone that he s going to get rid of Obamacare and replace it with something better, and quite honestly if his latest tweet is what he wants   liberals will likely get on board. However, in his idiocy, he probably doesn t realize what he just said.Trump tweeted out: Of course the Australians have better healthcare than we do  everybody does. ObamaCare is dead! But our healthcare will soon be great. Of course the Australians have better healthcare than we do  everybody does. ObamaCare is dead! But our healthcare will soon be great.  Donald J.

Please do!!Australia has a Medicare for all program for their citizens, and nations around the world have similar health systems that provide care for their nation s citizens. They take out the middleman of for-profit insurance, and give direct, affordable care, only increasing taxes slightly, and you no longer have the added expense of insurance premiums. AND EVERYONE IS COVERED.Now, this isn t likely what Trump meant to say, but it is what he said.The American Health Care Act, better known as Trumpcare, that passed yesterday in the House is simply a gift to the wealthy while stripping insurance and necessary benefits from those who need it most. That s NOT what Australia has, and would be far worse than anything else in the world.Twitter quickly reminded Trump that he s a moron:@realDonaldTrump Australia is part of the rest of the civilized world that has Universal HC.We can do better.#AHCA#FridayFeeling #TheResistance pic.twitter.com/X1K7f6mAg3  Holly O'Reilly (@AynRandPaulRyan) May 5, 2017@realDonaldTrump And why do you think that everybody else has better healthcare than we do?

 Bundy Militant Files $666 BILLION Lawsuit Against Government For ‘Damages From The Works Of The Devil’,"The moment the initial members of the Bundy militants were arrested, effectively ending the occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon, one thing was for certain: as paranoid, anti-government conspiracy theorists, these people could be counted on for some absolute batsh*t crazy legal defenses. But no one could anticipate the sheer stupidity of their other legal filings.Shawna Cox, the woman who falsely claimed that LaVoy Finicum was executed with his hands in the air when in actuality he was attempting to pull a gun on law enforcement, filed a lawsuit against the big, bad federal government. Cox is seeking a whopping $666,666,666,666.66 in damages because she says the government harmed her in performing  works of the devil    including her attempted execution.KATU reports that Cox, who managed to convince the court to do her a special favor in allowing her to attend Finicum s funeral, quickly found her lawsuit tossed out because her claims are not cognizable in this criminal proceeding and will not be addressed in this case. Cox maintains that she did not interfere with public employees when she and her friends undertook an armed occupation of the Refuge because  it was their choice not to come to work out of guilt,  that federal employees were  secretly extending the boundaries  of Malheur, and says that she is being  maliciously prosecuted by the State and Federal Bar Association members because they do not want to be held accountable for their subversive activities against the people of the United States of America. No one is safe from her wrath. Cox says she will be asking the jury to  render civil and criminal charges against  a number of  public officials,  including  All of the Oregon State Bar members, and public employees who were involved in the persecution, prosecutorial misconduct, and ineffective council involving the incarceration of the Hammonds, including each and every one of them who violated the separation of powers and held offices in the judiciary and / or legislative and /or executive branches at the same time,  anyone who interfered with the  militia s  attempt to form an illegal and unrecognized Grand Jury to prosecute public officials, and  all involved in the ambush that attempted to execute myself and others and executed LaVoy Finicum. She also says she wants charges against  all state, public, and federal officials involved in organizing and authorizing the ambush execution of myself and others including LaVoy Finicum  as well as  all of the state employees involved in the ambush that attempted to execute myself and others, and resulted in LaVoy Finicum s murder. Cox specifically names Judge Grasty, Senator Cliff Bentz, Harney County Prosecutor Tim Calhoun, Governor Kate Brown, U.S. prosecutors Dwight Holton, Kirk Engdall, Kelley Zusman, S. Amanda Marshall, Judge Hogan, and Judge Ann Aiken as well as  officials who committed crimes against the Hammond family and myself by omissions and misprision [sic] pf felony s [sic],  Sheriff David Ward and Special Agent Katherine Armstrong.She says she is seeking the $666 billion in damages because these individuals subjected her to  damages from the works of the devil. If this seems nuts to you, you re probably right. These armed and crazed individuals declared war on the federal government, openly, and have essentially received a slap on the wrist for their anti-government efforts.Words can not describe the insanity of this woman s claims, so read them for yourself.

" PROOF: Republicans Are Blocking Black Voters, This Court Case Is Exposing Them","Voter identification laws (aka Voter ID) are an attempt by Republican lawmakers to suppress the vote with demographics that often vote for Democratic candidates   young voters, minorities, the poor. Often, when confronted with this, conservatives claim that the laws are in place to protect the integrity of the ballot against so-called  voter fraud,  but time and time again studies have shown that  voter fraud  happens so infrequently it is almost nonexistent.In Wisconsin, failed Republican presidential candidate Governor Scott Walker praised the recent implementation of voter ID in Wisconsin s presidential primary. But one case shows that the law is just a fancy, modern version of Jim Crow:Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker said his state s strict new voter-ID requirement worked  just fine  in the April 5 primary, but thousands of Wisconsinites were unable to cast a ballot because of the new law. One of them was Eddie Lee Holloway Jr.Holloway, a 58-year-old African-American man, moved from Illinois to Wisconsin in 2008 and voted without problems, until Wisconsin passed its voter-ID law in 2011.  I never miss voting,  he said. He brought his expired Illinois photo ID, birth certificate, and Social Security card to get a photo ID for voting, but the DMV in Milwaukee rejected his application because the name on his birth certificate read  Eddie Junior Holloway,  the result of a clerical error when it was issued.The Nation goes on to report that Holloway ended up spending $200 on records, made trips between two states, and was still unable to vote in Wisconsin. The U.S. Court of Appeals is currently reviewing a case brought before it on behalf of Holloway by the ACLU. The ACLU estimates that there are thousands of people in Wisconsin who have been disenfranchised like him.This is exactly what Republicans want. They ve said it on the record, multiple times, that voter ID helps them because it suppresses the vote. Their party best succeeds when less and less people get to exercise their Constitutional rights.Featured image via Flickr"
 These Hilarious Donald Trump Impressions Prove That Other Candidates Hate Him Just As Much As We Do (VIDEOS),"Republican front-runner Donald Trump does a pretty amazing job making himself look like a complete moron, but he s given us so much material that impersonating such a ridiculous candidate has never been more fun.Trump s a character that almost seems too insane to be real. From his accent to his hand gestures and facial expressions, we ve never had a more animated presidential candidate   and that might not be a good thing. He s become loathed by not only every logically thinking American, but by nearly every politician   even members of the Republican party!Because of his distinct (and revolting) personality, Trump has been impersonated by comedians, talk show hosts and more. Mimicking this candidate is so entertaining that even politicians   his own rivals   can t help but get in on it! Here are some epic impersonations that have been done by the other candidates, at Trump s expense:Hillary Clinton (starting at the 3:00 mark)We think Clinton took the prize here, doing a dead-on impersonation of the annoying yet unforgettable way Trump speaks. She even got some of the facial expressions right!Following Clinton are the impressions done by Trump s GOP rivals, who are understandably less charismatic and less intelligent than Clinton, but they still deserve some credit for trying   even if you end up laughing at them instead.Ted Cruz (at the 1:00 mark)Ted Cruz is creepy as ever, but he does a good job at summing up what Trump does during debates while at the same time mocking him for skipping one.Jeb Bush (at the 1:00 mark)You can tell that Jeb Bush, who recently dropped out of the presidential race, isn t used to being funny   but even he could barely contain his laughter as he tried to capture Trump s personality in a few seconds for Stephen Colbert.Rand Paul (at the :40 mark)Ex-candidate Rand Paul actually tried to mimic Trump s voice, and it was pretty disastrous. However, he did a great job reflecting Trump s misogynistic attitude toward women, as well as the front runner s inflated ego.Chris Christie Another former candidate, Chris Christie, takes a stab at Trump s voice as he bashes him during a speech. Interestingly enough, Christie has now endorsed Trump and was recently embarrassed tremendously by the business mogul   probably for this horrible impression.While these politicians should have probably left the impersonations to the comedians, we can t blame them for wanting to make fun of everyone s least favorite person. We can only imagine what it s like to work so closely with someone as irritatingly awful as Trump   so these candidates can blast him all they want. But in closing, we ll leave you with this epic Trump impersonation from Jimmy Fallon, who absolutely nailed it:Featured image is a screenshot"
" Donald Trump Gets Schlonged By His Own Ghost Writer, Who Refuses To Vote For Him (AUDIO)","When Donald Trump  wrote  a book in 2000, he didn t think it would come back to bite him on the ass.But that book, and the man who actually wrote it, have surfaced to draw a picture of a Donald Trump who is doing the total opposite of what he said sixteen years ago.Dave Shiflett did the heavy lifting on Trump s book  The America We Deserve,  and during an appearance on Fox News Radio with Alan Colmes, the ghost writer slammed the Republican presidential wannabe for being a total asshole who has completely contradicted himself in an attempt to become the GOP nominee. I used to think it was my first work of fiction,  Shiflett said of the book before remarking that it s hard to know where Trump stands on anything because he s a thematic person.Shiflett went on to describe how Trump used to hold very progressive views such as supporting single-payer healthcare and tax increases on the wealthy. He also mentioned how Trump ironically used to criticize Pat Buchanan for saying  too many outrageous and controversial things  to be considered a serious candidate for the presidency. In short, Trump once believed that being outrageous and controversial automatically disqualifies someone from being commander-in-chief, which means he would be disqualified himself since he has clearly adopted Pat Buchanan s style.And despite being Trump s ghost writer, there is no way in hell that Shiflett is voting for him.In the beginning of his campaign, Trump attacked Senator John McCain for being a POW during the Vietnam War, a war that Trump avoided by dodging the draft. McCain was captured after being shot down by enemy forces and he was then brutally tortured to the point where he can no longer lift his arms over his head. Shiflett has been angry about Trump s treatment of McCain ever since, and for good reason. I ll tell you what really bugs me about him, where it really ripped it with me and Trump was the stuff he said about McCain. McCain suffered severely, and I had a son who did two tours in Middle East during the last war and we had kids from here who went over there and some of them got hurt. They ain t gonna be the same. Here s the audio via Buzzfeed:Sounds like Trump s criticism of McCain was the last straw for Shiflett, as it probably was for many Americans. The fact is that John McCain is a war hero who sacrificed for his country, something that Donald Trump refused to do when he had the same opportunity to fight during the war. Instead, Trump chose to dodge the draft through multiple deferments, including a questionable medical deferment.Also, the fact that Donald Trump is using the Pat Buchanan playbook in his run for president is scary, especially since it appears to actually be working this time around 24 years after Americans rejected it when Buchanan sought the Republican nomination in 1992. This just shows how racist and sexist the Republican Party has become over the last two and a half decades.Featured Image: YouTube"
 Pence Says There Is ‘Too Much Talk’ About Racism In Policing And Institutional Bias,"While Charlotte, North Carolina faces a state of emergency and unarmed black people continue to get shot dead by police, Mike Pence has a few words to say regarding the mounting racial tensions gripping this nation. To him, it s annoying   but not in the way one might think.As black people   who have done nothing wrong that warranted getting killed   lie dead in the street, Pence and Trump are annoyed hearing about it. How do we know? Because Pence was *smart* enough to admit it to reporters:Trump and I believe there s been far too much talk about institutional bias and racism within law enforcement.Gee, sorry black people dying and being targeted at disproportionate rates annoys you so much, Pence. Sorry the plight of black America is a burden to your message of  Build that Wall. Thirty-eight percent of the U.S. population is non-white. When a third of the population can fall victim to institutional bias and racism in law enforcement, the conversation (or  talk  as Pence puts it) is extremely important. Sorry if the talk makes your uncomfortable or triggers your prejudices, but it needs to happen. Skirting it under the rug or blaming it on drug use doesn t make it go away.The statistics tell us all we need to know:So, even with all these glaring statistics, Mike Pence thinks talking about it has been  far too much  for his and Trump s comfort.Newsflash, Pence: you re running for Vice President of the United States, not Vice President of the white community. If the talk is too much, get out of the race.We already know Trump doesn t care about the black community nor does he want to actually fix anything that afflicts it, but Pence was supposed to give the illusion that a potential Trump Administration would care. That s been shattered.Good luck getting the black vote in November when you completely wish to disregard what hurts them the most: systemic racism.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images"
"BREAKING: GA, KY, WV Confirm They Suspect Obama’s DHS Hacked Their Election Networks [VIDEO]","Georgia s secretary of state has claimed the Department of Homeland Security tried to breach his office s firewall and has issued a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson asking for an explanation.Brian Kemp issued a letter to Johnson on Thursday after the state s third-party cybersecurity provider detected an IP address from the agency s Southwest D.C. office trying to penetrate the state s firewall. According to the letter, the attempt was unsuccessful.And now, Channel 2 Investigative Reporter Aaron Diamond has learned two more states  election agencies have confirmed suspected cyberattacks linked to the same U.S. Department of Homeland Security IP address as last month s massive attack in Georgia.The two states reporting the suspected cyberattacks were West Virginia and Kentucky. We need somebody to dig down into this story and figure out exactly what happened,  said Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp.In the past week, the Georgia Secretary of State s Office has confirmed 10 separate cyberattacks on its network over the past 10 months that were traced back to DHS addresses. We re being told something that they think they have it figured out, yet nobody s really showed us how this happened,  Kemp said.  We need to know. He says the new information from the two other states presents even more reason to be concerned. So now this just raises more questions that haven t been answered about this and continues to raise the alarms and concern that I have,  Kemp said.Through an open-records request, Diamant acquired the results of a survey Kemp asked the National Association of Secretaries of State to send to its members.West Virginia wrote back,  This IP address did access our election night results on November 7, 2016.  Kentucky responded the same IP address  did touch the KY (online voter registration) system on one occasion, 11/1/16. In a letter this week, DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson told Kemp the department sourced the mid-November activity in Georgia to a federal contractor conducting what he called  normal  internet searches on the Secretary of State s website. But Kemp says there s a problem with that answer. We haven t been able to recreate this the way they explained it to us,  Kemp said.Kemp also told Diamant that DHS has yet to explain at least nine other suspected network scans linked to DHS IP addresses over the last year on or around important primary and presidential election dates. Kemp s call for answers is amplified now by the National Association of Secretaries of State, or NASS.   WSBTV"
LOUDMOUTH ROSIE O’DONNELL Just Bullied The Wrong Trump: OUTRAGED Melania Threatens Lawsuit After Rosie Pushes False Video On Twitter About 10 Yr Old Barron,"Remember when children of the President or President-elect used to be  off limits  to the press or even those who may have objected to the the views of the President? I wonder how Rosie would feel about someone spreading a totally unfounded rumor about one of her children all over social media Melania Trump has hired a famous lawyer who is now threatening a lawsuit over a video suggesting her 10-year-old son, Barron, is autistic, and the letter calls out Rosie O Donnellas a bully.According to the letter, obtained by TMZ, the YouTube video falsely insinuates Barron is autistic. The letter, and our sources familiar with the situation, say Barron absolutely is not autistic.Rosie tweeted out the video last week, with a caption,  Barron Trump Autistic?  The letter says,  The video allegedly seeks to  stop the bullying  of Barron Trump. Not true   The video did instigate further bullying by Rosie O Donnell and others. https://youtu.be/yZAd5Pu9iw4The video lists a number of signs it claims points to autism, including Barron clapping without slapping his hands together. Melania s attorney, Charles J. Harder, says Barron did this once   at the end of a long day at the RNC   but the  vast majority of the time, he claps normally. The video shows Barron yawning and grimacing during his father s victory speech at the RNC and on election night. Melania s team says both events were late at night, and Barron was exhibiting normal behavior for a 10-year-old.Melania is not threatening to sue Rosie, but her attorney, Harder, wants the person who posted the YouTube clip to delete it and post an apology.Our sources say Melania is outraged and is serious about going after the person who posted the video if he doesn t take it down."
" Curt Schilling Doubles Down On Transgender Hate On Facebook, Adds Racism (IMAGE)","After ESPN fired washed-up MLB pitcher Curt Schilling, and rightfully so, for posting an extremely transphobic image on his Facebook page, he decided that wasn t enough hate, so now he s added some racism to the mix.Clearly pissed that he lost his job, Schilling decided to repost an image put out by conservative blogger and wannabe comedian Steven Crowder. In the image it throws noted writer and activist Shaun King under the bus in its pathetic attempt to be funny. Which, I m sure to the myopic, racist and transphobic crowd Crowder plays to, is hilarious.The image says: Liberal Logic:Shaun King: Fakes being a black man.

Here s the image: via FacebookNow anyone with half a brain knows that Shaun King, who has time and time again been accused of lying about his race, and has struggled through his own past to appease those who don t understand things that aren t as simple as black and white, is indeed a man of color speaking his own unique truth.But clearly, many conservatives, especially those like Crowder and Schilling who like to make fun of and are clearly afraid of anyone different from themselves, can t wrap their head around this sort of thing.And not only is Schilling not apologizing for his transphobic hatred that got him fired, he s now doubling down on it.As a diehard Boston Red Sox fan, who was proud during the bloody sock moments, I couldn t be more disgusted at this pathetic little scrap of a man who can t bring himself to basic human decency and recognize there are people on this planet who are, indeed, transgender.Schilling, at this point, delete your account.

SECRET DUMPS OF TOXIC WASTE ON PRIVATE PROPERTY BY EPA: Will The Government Bullies At The EPA Finally Be Exposed?,"This story gets more and more unbelievable every day The EPA has a record of releasing toxic runoff from mines in two tiny Colorado towns that dates to 2005, a local mine owner claims.The 3-million-gallon heavy-metal spill two weeks ago in Silverton polluted three states and touched off national outrage. But the EPA escaped public wrath in 2005 when it secretly dumped up to 15,000 tons of poisonous waste into another mine 124 miles away. That dump   containing arsenic, lead and other materials   materialized in runoff in the town of Leadville, said Todd Hennis, who owns both mines along with numerous others. If a private company had done this, they would ve been fined out of existence,  Hennis said.  I have been battling the EPA for 10 years and they have done nothing but create pollution. About 20 percent (of Silverton residents) think it s on purpose so they can declare the whole area a Superfund site. Like Silverton to the south, Leadville was founded in the late 1800s as a mining town and is the only municipality in its county. Today, tourism is its livelihood.It s against this backdrop that the Environmental Protection Agency began lobbying to declare part of Leadville a Superfund site in order to develop a recreational area called the Mineral Belt Trail. The project was officially completed in 2000, but apparently the agency stayed on and continued to work in town.In late 2005, the EPA collected tons of sludge from two Leadville mines and secretly dumped it down the shaft of the New Mikado mine without notifying Hennis, its owner, according to documents reviewed by Watchdog.A drainage tunnel had been installed at the bottom of the mine shaft by the U.S. government in 1942, meaning that any snow or rain would leach toxins into the surrounding land.Hennis said the EPA claims it has installed a treatment pond near the tunnel to clean runoff. The EPA rebuffed his demands to clean up the mess it created in his mine, he said. In frustration, Hennis sent the county sheriff a certified notice that any EPA officials found near his property were trespassing and should be arrested.Despite that history of bitterness, in 2010, the EPA asked Hennis to grant its agents access to Gold King Mine in Silverton because the agency was investigating hazardous runoff from other mines in the region. I said,  No, I don t want you on my land out of fear that you will create additional pollution like you did in Leadville,  Hennis said. The official request turned into a threat, Hennis said:  They said,  If you don t give us access within four days, we will fine you $35,000 a day. An EPA administrative order dated May 12, 2011 said its inspectors wanted to conduct  drilling of holes and installing monitoring wells, sampling and monitoring water, soil, and mine waste material from mine water rock dumps as necessary to evaluate releases of hazardous substances When the EPA hit Hennis with $300,000 in fines, he said, he  waved the white flag  and allowed the agency on his property.So for the past four years, the EPA has been working at the mine and two others nearby   all which border a creek that funnels into the Animas River. One mine to the north had been walled off with cement by its owner but it continued to leak water into Gold King. The EPA installed a drainage ditch on the Gold King side of the mine to alleviate the problem, but then accidentally filled the ditch with dirt and rocks last summer while building a water-retention wall.That was the wall that burst when a contractor punched a hole in the top on Aug. 5, sending a bright orange stream cascading down. The EPA looked like the Keystone Kops as anger intensified in the media and general public: 24 hours passed with no notification to the lower states or Navajo Nation; the White House ignored mentioning the incident; and it took a week for the EPA administrator to tour Durango downstream, while refusing to visit Silverton itself.The EPA says cleaning ponds have been installed to leach toxins from the water, and claims that anything released now is actually cleaner than before the spill occurred. The fallout from this disaster in the lower states is still unknown.Also unknown is the fate of Silverton itself. For months, the EPA has been pushing town leaders into allowing designation as a Superfund site out of belief that the whole town is contaminated. This is something the town has resisted, as its reputation is at stake and no current tests have shown any evidence of toxic soil levels. Whenever we hear the word  EPA,  we think of Superfund,  said Silverton Town Board Trustee David Zanoni.  They say,  We want to work together.  That s B.S. They want to come in and take over. The water up here is naturally filled with minerals. They don t need to be here cleaning up. If the EPA s litany of mistakes at Gold King mine is a barometer, Zanoni said, handing over the reins of Silverton would be a disaster. They had no contingency plan in case all of this went to hell,  he said.The EPA could not be reached for comment.Via: Watchdog.org"

"¡VIVA LA REVOLUTION! As Venezuela Collapses Under Socialist Rule, Dictator Maduro Endorses Fellow Socialist Bernie Sanders","The leader of the worst economy on the planet is endorsing fellow Socialist Bernie Sanders. Let that sink in Yes It s  A future you can believe in  if you re an abject idiot who doesn t have access to a single news source. VENEZUELA TODAY: The army has moved in, Coca-Cola has stopped production and inflation is expected to hit 500 per cent.Venezuela s economic crisis has ratcheted up a gear in the last week after President Nicholas Maduro deployed the army to strategic areas for two days of  war games  designed as a show of strength to a population increasingly pitted against him.The drastic escalation follows a major deterioration in the country s finances that have seen widespread shortages of food, basic goods and power cuts, fueled by years of economic mismanagement and corruption that have seen unemployment skyrocket to 17 per cent as the oil price has plummeted.University College London s leadership professor Marco Aponte-Moreno, who was born and raised in Caracas, told news.com.au the past few days had seen the stakes raised for both corrupt officials and those dying from lack of food and medicine in his home country. The stakes are very high [for the government] if they lose power,  he said, adding that many involved in illegal activities could be charged and taken to trial. The situation has become a matter of life and death for the government and also a matter of life and death for the people because people are dying because they don t have their medicines, the water they need. It s very sad to see the country like this, especially when you take into account that this is a country that has large natural resources. I have to admit it isn t a surprise. Corruption, shortages are things that are not new in Venezuela but they have never reached this level before. Via- News.comauVenezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has endorsed fellow socialist Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., for president, calling him  our revolutionary friend. In a televised address on Tuesday, Maduro criticized the U.S. election system, which he called  archaic,  for putting Sanders at a disadvantage. If the elections were free,  Maduro said,  Bernie Sanders would be president of the United States. Socialist Venezuela, which has been criticized for lack of transparency in elections, frequently denounces the U.S. government and accuses it of imperialism. The South American country is also prone to blaming its economic woes on Washington, and the two countries do not exchange ambassadors.Is this the America so many college students are dreaming of?Venezuela teeters on the brink of collapse, with low global oil prices contributing to massive shortage of basic goods like flour and toilet paper. The government recently moved to a two-day work week for public employees in an effort to conserve electricity.Maduro, who has publicly denounced President Barack Obama, said Sanders  ought to win in the United States.  The Vermont senator trails frontrunner Hillary Clinton and has little chance of amassing the delegates needed to receive the Democratic nomination. Via: The Olympian "
 Clinton Ad SLAMS Trump For His Disgusting Insults Towards Women And Their Bodies,"It s no wonder Trump is losing   and losing badly   with women. A new poll from McClatchy-Marist shows Clinton leading Trump by 24 points among registered female voters (58 percent to 34 percent), and 23 points among likely female voters. Remember, Mitt Romney lost the female vote by 11 points, and John McCain by 13 points.While the Trump campaign and his supporters scratch their heads as to why he s performing so poorly with the demographic that makes up the majority of the country, the Clinton campaign is reminding them why.A new (and brutal) ad has just been released from the Clinton camp. Asking voters if Trump is  the president we want for our daughters?  the ad, titled Mirrors, uses the Donald s deplorable, sexist, offensive and objectifying words against women against him. From,  I d look her right in that ugly face of hers,  to A person who s flat-chested is very hard for them to be a 10,  Mirrors showcases women all across the country looking at themselves   their bodies, appearance   at their phones, wondering if they are worthy, as Trump s disgusting words echo off the screen.When talking about Kim Kardashian, Trump thought it would be a good idea to talk about her famous asset:  Does she have a good body? No. Does she have a fat ass? Absolutely. So presidential.The most damning part comes at the end, when Howard Stern asks Trump,  So you treat women with respect? Trump s answer? No, I can t say that either. This ad is so powerful. Trump, who is well known to be a serial misogynist, sexist, and all around pig, should be ashamed of the way he regards women, their appearances, and livelihoods. No wonder his first wife cited  cruel and inhumane  treatment as the grounds for their divorce, and called him a  chauvinist  on TV.Little girls, and indeed little boys, are watching. Their parents have a choice: do we elect a man who has a proven track record of demeaning women he doesn t even know, or do we elect a woman who wants to tap everyone s potential, no matter who they are or what they look like.Watch the powerful ad that showcases just how much of a pig Donald Trump is:Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images"

Tucker Carlson had more to say on this:  What are these transactions? Basically any commercial activity that Trump or his family and associates conducted over the last decade that might pertain to Russia or anyone who has ever lived in Russia. Let s be clear about the politics here. This is a massive threat to the White House. A determined prosecutor can prove almost anything he wants. A prosecutor with no time limit or budget or accountability to voters? There is nobody more dangerous than that. The investigation has been slammed by very reputable lawyers who happen to be Democrats! This needs to end ASAP!
TARGET CAVES AFTER CUSTOMERS BOYCOTT Of Transgender Bathroom Policy Takes Toll Bottom Line,"Way to go! Target has suffered financially since the boycott over their  transgender bathroom policy so they re making a move now so little kids don t have to be exposed to transponders using their bathroom. Target reportedly plans to spend $20 million on adding single-stall bathrooms to all of its locations by next year, in an apparent move to placate shoppers outraged over its transgender bathroom policy. It s clear that some of our guests like and some dislike our inclusive bathroom policy,  Target Chief Financial Officer Cathy Smith told reporters in a media briefing, Fortune magazine reported Wednesday.Ms. Smith did not say whether the backlash had cost Target business, but added,  We are not satisfied with our second quarter traffic and sales performance. The single-stall bathrooms, which are already in a  vast majority  of Target locations, are expected to be fully installed by March, Fortune reported.In April, the discount retailer sparked national backlash and calls for a boycott after announcing its transgender-friendly bathroom policy, which allows transgender employees and customers to use the bathroom that  corresponds with their gender identity.

" Trump Decides To Gut United Nations Funding By 50 Percent, Embarrassing And Endangering America On The World Stage","Donald Trump has decided to go through with his threat to defund the United Nations in retaliation for making a decision he didn t like.America has been the foremost leader on the international stage ever since World War II. After the war, the United States led the way in creating a more united and cooperative world by founding the United Nations to serve as a peacekeeping and humanitarian organization.The United Nations headquarters in located in New York and America has veto power and a seat on the prestigious United Nations Security Council.But now Donald Trump is preparing to slash funding to the United Nations by 50 percent, a move that would be a major blow against international cooperation and our reputation around the globe.Not only will the United Nations be cut by $5 billion, Trump s plan also makes a 37 percent cut to the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development budgets.And it s all in an effort by Trump to increase the already bloated military budget.United Nations expert Richard Gowan warned that cutting the funding would cause chaos and could cause agencies and programs within the United Nations to implode as other countries struggle to fill the gaps. Cutting the U.S. contribution would leave a gaping hole that other big donors would struggle to fill,  Gowan said.  Multiply that across other humanitarian agencies, like the World Food Program, and you are basically talking about the breakdown of the international humanitarian system as we know it. Indeed, the budget cuts could be devastating to the United Nations and threaten to bury international cooperation as we know it.Republicans have even drafted a bill directing Trump to withdraw the United States from the organization entirely.That means the United States would also be withdrawing from the World Bank, the International Court of Justice, the World Health Organization, the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and the International Atomic Energy Agency, among many others.And because the United States is cutting funding, the United Nations may look to China or Russia to replace the funding, which could pave the way for a new power structure as the United States withdraws support.It s not only a serious blow to humanitarian efforts and global peacekeeping efforts, it s a serious rejection of international diplomacy and cooperation.And it s all because Trump and Republicans did not like that the United Nations passed a resolution condemning the continued building of Israeli settlements on Palestinian territory even though such resolutions have passed before.Trump is literally defunding the United Nations because they didn t comply with his demands despite the fact that President Obama was still in office at the time.This is absolutely humiliating for the United States and it should horrify the American people that Trump is withdrawing our country from the international community. Our influence and respect throughout the world will wane because of this decision and it will be difficult to regain it.America is once again becoming an isolationist nation, and the last time we ignored the world around us over 100 million people were killed in two world wars. By ignoring the world again and the growing humanitarian crisis, we are paving the way for World War III. And make no mistake, such a war today will make the first two world wars look like minor skirmishes.Featured Image: Wikimedia"
 Hypocrite Republicans Refuse To Investigate Flynn Scandal,"After years of investigating Hillary Clinton over Benghazi despite her resignation, Republicans are hypocritically refusing to investigate Michael Flynn.Donald Trump s national security adviser Michael Flynn resigned late on Monday night after getting busted for negotiating with the Russians while President Obama was still in office.Flynn s actions violated the Logan Act, which bars citizens from negotiating with foreign powers. Flynn s connections with Vladimir Putin run deep, and the Justice Department warned Trump last month that Flynn was at risk of being blackmailed by the Russians. Still, Trump kept Flynn on his team and even let him continue participating in meetings.Flynn, the national security adviser, was literally a national security threat and Trump refused to act.This comes months after an election that was tainted by interference from the Russians, and Republicans have yet to investigate that.And they are not going to investigate the Flynn scandal either.GOP Rep. Jason Chaffetz told reporters on Tuesday,  I think that situation has taken care of itself. I think he did the right thing stepping down. By that logic, the Benghazi investigation should have ended after Clinton stepped down as Secretary of State in February 2013. But Republicans continued the investigation into December 2016.Chaffetz then passed the buck by claiming that the House Intelligence Committee is responsible for investigating Flynn, not the Oversight Committee.When asked by reporters if he would launch an investigation, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes said he doesn t plan to do so and even went on to praise Flynn in the hope that the scandal will be swept under the rug.Here s the lawmaker who should be investigating Flynn and Trump s Russia ties, House Intel Chair Devin Nunes.Really taking this seriously. pic.twitter.com/ygfiajpYq3  Matt Fuller (@MEPFuller) February 14, 2017And so, Republicans once again demonstrate that they are complete hypocrites.Republicans like Chaffetz spent years and wasted millions of taxpayer dollars to investigate Hillary Clinton over Benghazi. It was a witch hunt that went beyond the amount of time Congress spent investigating 9/11 and in the end it found nothing.Republicans literally accused Clinton of  national security malpractice  even though it was their cuts of diplomatic security funding that played a role in the lack of security at the consulate.Nothing Hillary Clinton could have done in response would have saved the four Americans who died in the attack. Furthermore, there have been even deadlier terrorist attacks against American embassies overseas that did not result in investigations, especially when such attacks occurred under Republican administrations.But Michael Flynn broke the law, lied about his phone calls with the Russian ambassador, and was a national security threat because of his closeness to the Russians, particularly Putin, and was at risk of being blackmailed.This is a major scandal of the Trump administration and the American people are demanding a lengthy and thorough investigation by Congress. The fact that Republicans don t want to do it shows how little credibility these lawmakers have. They don t really care about our national security. They only care about launching investigations for political gain.They are hypocrites and they should be ousted from office in favor of people who will conduct a proper investigation into this matter. And when that investigation exposes Trump s collusion with Russia we ll all know why Republicans didn t want to investigate Flynn. Because protecting the party is more important to them than protecting America.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images"
 Trump’s Meeting With Germany’s Angela Merkel Goes From Awkward To Offensive In Seconds (VIDEO),"A sit-down meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel went from painfully awkward to downright offensive when Trump couldn t even muster an ounce of humility and grace. During a photo op, the two world leaders sat in stony silence as photographers did their best to try to capture a picture that showed some warmth between what are supposed to be two close allies. Instead they got Trump looking like his dad just told him they wouldn t be getting ice cream after all and Merkel squirming in discomfort.Trump s obvious irritability was bizarre to begin with, but his refusal to interact with Merkel only got worse. When a reporter suggested the pair give a handshake (as is customary when two leaders meet for the first time), Merkel leaned over to Trump to ask if he wanted to give it a go only to have Trump continue to stare straight ahead, ignoring her. She stared in astonishment, then resignation. The realization that the President of the United States really is this pathetic was written all over her face.Photographers: Can we get a handshake? Merkel (to Trump): Do you want to have a handshake? Trump: *no response* Merkel: *makes awkward face* pic.twitter.com/ehgpCnWPg7  David Mack (@davidmackau) March 17, 2017Trump could have been in a bad mood for any number of reasons. His healthcare plan is going down in flames. His budget cuts   which focus primarily on stripping funding away from the elderly and children in favor of more military spending   are getting some of the worst press since his Muslim ban. His second Muslim ban was just shot down by two federal judges. And his plan to accuse the British government of helping Obama wiretap him didn t just blow up in his face, but actually caused an international scandal. Or it could be the fact that Germany has shown zero interest in indulging his tantrums.Whatever the cause, America just got another clear reminder that the damage Trump is doing isn t just domestic. He s undermining relationships with crucial allies in ways that may take decades to repair. And he s not even willing to give a simple handshake to prevent it.Featured image via Twitter"
WOW!

But assuming she wins, and the investigation goes forward, and it looks an indictment is pending, at that point and time under the Constitution, the House of Representatives would engage in an impeachment trial, they would go to the Senate and impeachment proceedings and removal would take place https://twitter.com/TEN_GOP/status/793918006359298048"
TWISTED LIBERAL KINDERGARTEN Teacher Allows Transgender Student To “REVEAL” Her “TRUE GENDER” To Class,"Silly parents you don t get to decide if, or when to talk to your kids about the .03% of the population who consider themselves to be  transgender.  And oh yeah your kids teacher will also inform your child that the gender they re born with doesn t matter, and that they can actually choose the gender they identify with.  Because liberal educators know better than you what s best for your child.The Rocklin Academy school board is facing tough questions from parents concerned over a controversial incident involving transgender discussions inside a kindergarten class. These parents feel betrayed by the school district that they were not notified,  said Karen England with the Capitol Resource Institute.WATCH:The incident happened earlier this summer during the last few days of the academic school year.At Monday night s board meeting, the teacher at the center of the controversy spoke out. With emotions high, she addressed a packed house. I m so proud of my students, it was never my intent to harm any students but to help them through a difficult situation,  she said.The teacher defended her actions to read two children s books about transgenderism including one titled  I am Jazz.  She says the books were given to her by a transgender child going through a transition. The kindergartners came home very confused, about whether or not you can pick your gender, whether or not they really were a boy or a girl,  said England.And many parents say they feel betrayed and blindsided. I want her to hear from me as a parent what her gender identity means to her and our family, not from a book that may be controversial,  a parent said. My daughter came home crying and shaking so afraid she could turn into a boy,  another parent said.The issue was not on the agenda, so parents spoke out during public comment. It s really about the parents being informed and involved and giving us the choice and rights of what s being introduced to our kids, and at what age,  said parent Chelsea McQuistan.Many teachers also spoke out in support of what transpired inside the classroom. They spoke about the importance of teaching students about diversity and having healthy dialogues.Unlike sex education, the topics of gender identity don t require prior parental notice.

"REMEMBER WHEN Democrats, Media Mocked Betsy DeVos For Suggesting Schools May Need Guns To Protect Against Bears?…Look What Just Happened!","A few weeks ago, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos   a West Michigan native and Detroit charter schools advocate   was widely mocked when she suggested during her confirmation hearing that educators may need  a gun in the school to protect from potential grizzlies. Her point was the issue of whether guns belong in American schools is  best left to locales and states to decide.  But social media went off the rails after the  grizzlies  comment, with most people saying it s preposterous to suggest a gun should be in a school, around schoolchildren, due to a threat of bears.Watch Trump s Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos cite grizzly bears as a reason states should decide if schools should be allowed to have guns (or not):Citing grizzlies, Trump education pick Betsy DeVos says states should determine school gun policies https://t.co/A8pBds868b pic.twitter.com/qxS1X34aJf  CNN (@CNN) January 18, 2017For those who ridiculed Betsy DeVos for mentioning  potential grizzlies  as a reason for keeping a gun in schools for safety, it may be time to start lining up to apologize: A bear put a pair of Connecticut schools on lockdown this week.Two schools in Southington, Conn., were placed in  Secure School Mode  when a black bear was spotted nearby Tuesday morning, according to WFSB.com.Though the bear eventually moved away from the schools and the  Secure School Mode  was only brief, the report says emails were sent out to parents and the schools took precautions to keep schoolchildren safe.

 Trump Plans To Celebrate 100th Day On Office With Another YUUGE Rally No One Will Show Up For,"Donald Trump is really excited about all the nothing he s accomplished in his first 100 days in office. So, he announced on Saturday that he plans to celebrate by throwing a  big rally  on his 100th day. Presumably, he expects a better turnout than he got for his pathetic inauguration.Next Saturday night I will be holding a BIG rally in Pennsylvania. Look forward to it!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 22, 2017Rally will be to mark Trump s 100 days in office & organized/paid for by Trump s campaign committee, per senior campaign official https://t.co/wYW92Z8a87  Jeremy Diamond (@JDiamond1) April 22, 2017So far, with 100 days under his belt, Trump hasn t managed to accomplish squat except for failing to follow through on his absurd campaign promises. Mexico isn t paying for his stupid wall. His Muslim Ban was shot down twice as bigoted and unconstitutional. Obamacare is still the law of the land. And he is known as the biggest recruiting tool ISIS has at the moment. Exactly why he thinks this warrants a party is unclear. But as can only be expected of a narcissist, he is somehow convinced that this is a great idea and it totally won t have an embarrassing turnout.It is worth pointing out that the day of Trump s  big rally  is the same night the White House Correspondents  Dinner will be taking place   without the man occupying the White House in attendance because the press hurt his feelings.On Friday, Trump tweeted that the 100-day mark is a  ridiculous standard. No matter how much I accomplish during the ridiculous standard of the first 100 days, & it has been a lot (including S.C.), media will kill!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 21, 2017He then followed up by telling the press that it s  just an artificial barrier.  He added that since he didn t have the slightest clue how to actually president when he took office, he should be given extra leeway. He also noted that even though repealing Obamacare was one of his biggest campaign promises, he has really only been thinking about if for two months. I ve been here 92 days, but I ve only been working on the health care, you know, I had to get like a little bit of grounding, right?  Trump told the Associated Press.  Health care started after 30 day(s), so I ve been working on health care for 60 days. Featured image via Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images"

IMMIGRANTS FROM SOVIET UNION Want To Know Why Americans Support Bernie Sanders,"It s a pity the millennials who support Bernie Sanders have never had to stand in a bread line. They ve never had to watch everything their parents have worked so hard for, be taken away by their government. They don t make the connection that there s more to life than a  free college.  The huge deductions these millennials see on their paychecks usually takes care of the naive attitude of the immature, idealistic crybabies. People who escaped the former Soviet Union and came to America are not feeling the Bern. Perhaps because they know exactly what it s like to live in the socialist utopia Bernie Sanders wants for America.The Atlantic reports:Why Soviet Refugees Aren t Buying Sanders s SocialismSAN FRANCISCO Janna Sundeyeva still remembers life in the Soviet Union, where stores in remote regions would lack meat for months at a time and toilet paper had to be snatched up quickly on the rare occasions it appeared.But the minor indignities paled in comparison to what happened to her grandfather: He had the chance to come to America in 1929, but he opted to stay, sensing an economic thaw. Seven years later, Sundeyeva says, he was arrested and never heard from again.Sundeyeva immigrated to San Francisco from Moldova in 1994, and now she and her husband run a Russian-language newspaper here called Kstati. Her Soviet experience colors how she sees U.S. politics to this day. I don t like big government,  Sundeyeva said. She made two circles with her thumbs and forefingers and pressed them against each other so they touched, like binoculars. This Venn diagram represents the interests of people and government, she said.  They don t have very much in common. Today, she s not a registered Republican, but like many of the readers of her newspaper, she said she s starting to lean toward supporting Donald Trump for president. The other self-styled outsider in the race, though, holds no appeal for her. The only Bern she and many other Russians here are feeling is the one in the banya.To Sundeyeva, left-wingers seem to yearn for a workers  revolution.  I would ask them: Have you ever lived under a revolution?  she said.  Do you know what it s like? When someone comes and takes your family member in the night? Interviews with more than a dozen immigrants from the former Soviet Union in the Bay Area suggest that some in the community are recoiling from Bernie Sanders and his leftist ideals. One hundred years after the Bolshevik Revolution swept Communists into power, some Russians in America say they can t believe a serious candidate in the United States is calling himself a socialist.Many of us can t believe it either, folks.Bernie s support among young people can be chalked up to ignorance. Millennials have no memory of the Soviet Union or the horrors people endured under socialism. They ve grown up in the most free country in the world and have never wanted for anything.

 WATCH: Trump’s Treasury Sec. Steve Mnuchin Says NFL Players Have No Right To Free Speech,"Donald Trump is clearly violating the free speech rights of NFL players, and his weaselly Treasury Secretary supports it.As we all know, Trump has been waging a war against the NFL since calling quarterback Colin Kaepernick a  son of a bitch  on Friday night and demanding that NFL team owners fire players who kneel during the national anthem. On Saturday night, and into Sunday morning, Trump lashed out at the NFL in a tirade that made it clear that Trump opposes free speech and the Constitution that protects it.If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL,or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect .  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 23, 2017 our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem. If not, YOU RE FIRED. Find something else to do!  Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2017 NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country. League should back U.S.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2017That s right. Trump accused an American business of being anti-American for not firing players who kneel during the anthem in protest of police brutality and racial injustice. In short, Trump ordered the NFL to fire players who exercise their freedom of speech and expression. That means the government is now actively trying to force private institutions to silence and punish free speech.And Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin agreed with what Trump is doing, and even went full hypocrite by defending Trump s vile language. The owners should have a rule that players should have to stand and have respect for the national anthem,  Mnuchin told ABC host Martha Raddatz.  This isn t about Democrats, this isn t about Republicans, it s not about race, it s not about free speech. They can do free speech on their own time. The Constitution protects freedom of speech. This is something that Mnuchin clearly does not understand, which should automatically disqualify him from being in government.When asked about Trump s language, Mnuchin argued that  the president can use whatever language he wants to use.  In other words, white racists like Trump have freedom of speech, but black NFL players do not.Mnuchin then butchered the First Amendment even further by claiming that NFL players only  have the right to have the First Amendment off the field.  And that s complete bullshit. Clearly, Mnuchin failed basic civics in school.Here s the video via YouTube.The government, including the president, can t order a business to violate the free speech rights of their employees. Donald Trump owes an apology to the players whom he offended with his outrageously divisive remarks. No one can be forced to stand for the national anthem, just as no child can be forced to stand and recite the Pledge of Allegiance. It s unconstitutional.Featured image via video screen capture "
UNREAL! CBS’S TED KOPPEL Tells Sean Hannity He’s “Bad for America” [Video], 
 Seven-Year-Old Boy Accidentally Kills Father With High-Powered Rifle,"A seven-year-old Alma, Michigan boy accidentally shot and killed his sleeping father on Thursday night.According to police, the seven-year-old snuck out of bed while the rest of the family was sleeping. It appears that the family s guns were  safely  locked in a cabinet.Police say the boy found the key and used it to open the gun cabinet. He removed a high-powered rifle and the gun went off. A single bullet struck his father, who was sleeping in bed, next to the boy s mother.Officers and paramedics were called to the home a little after midnight. The man s injuries were fatal.The deadly shooting took place in a quiet neighborhood. Upon hearing the news, neighbors of the family said they were in shock. They had caution tape up and I saw three cops there,  one neighbor told WNEM. I m sorry to hear everything. It s a real tough time,  he said.Ellie Martin, a fourteen-year-old girl who lives next door to the family, told WNEM that she was  really freaked out  by what happened. I m not a religious person, but like, I prayed that everyone is OK. We don t have a lot of that around here,  she said.The girl went on to say, I just, I hope things get better for them. Not that there s any way of getting back up from that, but just so they can work through it and be OK. A third neighbor said he also has a seven-year-old child at home.  That makes me think a lot,  he told the news station.Contrary to NRA myths, having a gun in the home does not make you or your family safer. It seriously increases the risk that someone in your home will die from a gunshot wound.Even if you think a gun is stored safely and you believe that you ve taught your kids never to touch it, there s always a chance that you re wrong. It s a risk that is not worth taking.Featured image via Pixabay"
 Trump Just Told Prince Charles To Eat Sh*t For An Absolutely RIDICULOUS Reason,"Donald Trump is slated to visit Great Britain this summer, and meet with Prince Charles while he s there. And the White House warned Prince Charles to avoid  lecturing  Trump on issues like climate change:Members of Trump s inner circle have warned British officials that it would be counterproductive for Charles to  lecture  Trump on green issues during the president s June visit to Britain, and that the president will  erupt  if pushed, the Sunday Times of London reported.Well, isn t that a nice way of telling Prince Charles to fuck off if he brings up climate change. One could even take that to be some kind of veiled threat, but it s more likely that came from Trump needing to feel like he knows everything about everything and doesn t need to be educated on anything.Trump is a known climate-denier and also has, ahem, a tendency to fly off the handle when anyone tries to tell him he s wrong, he screwed up, or basically doesn t kiss his boots and his ass. He still hasn t grasped the fact that he s the least popular person to assume the highest office in our nation, let alone that people won t immediately acknowledge his amazing intelligence and understanding of the world.He s been looking to pull the U.S. out of the big Paris climate accord as quickly as possible, even looking for ways to circumvent the four-year process for withdrawing. He believes that environmental regulations are harmful to business and that we must do away with them. He wants to do away with them so badly he scrubbed all mention of climate change from the White House s website the instant he was sworn in, and started gagging federal agencies directly involved with environmental issues to boot.Prince Charles, however, has not ruled out bringing the subject up, even though he ll probably try and work to avoid the appearance of  lecturing.  Sadly, though, Trump will probably see any talk that doesn t fit his views to a tee as  lecturing. The White House is treating Prince Charles like he s the egotistical know-it-all who should shut up and listen. But what can we expect from an administration that openly and loudly calls for members of the press to be fired for reporting facts they don t like?Photo of Prince Charles by Arthur Edwards -WPA Pool/Getty Images.

(VIDEO) UNBELIEVABLE! BLACK JUDGE BERATES VICTIMS OF HOME INVASION AND YOU WON’T BELIEVE WHY,"You won t believe this judge and how he berates a family that was terrorized in a home invasion. Can a three-year old help how she feels after this traumatic event?The reason Judge Olu Stevens of Louisville, Kentucky berated a family that was terrorized by two black home invaders   in court and on Facebook   will knock your socks off. In all my years, I don t think I ve ever seen such an egregious example of race-card abuse.The judge was  troubled  and  offended  by the fact that a three year victim was so traumatized by a violent home invasion, she is now fearful of black males.Jordan and Tommy Gray s 3-year old daughter was watching  SpongeBob  when two black armed men broke into her home and robbed her family at gunpoint   one of the perps pointing a gun in her father s face.Mom and dad honestly noted on the their victim impact statement that she is still afraid of black men 2 years later. Whenever we are running errands, if we come across a black male, she holds me tight and begs me to leave,  the mother said.  It has affected her friendships at school and our relationships with African-American friends. Tommy Gray also wrote that since the crime, his daughter had been terrified of black males and that probation was not sufficient punishment for Gregory Wallace, 27, who had pleaded guilty to robbery. If holding a little girl at gunpoint gets you probation, then our system is flawed,  Gray said.But when Wallace was brought up for sentencing Feb. 4 in Jefferson Circuit Court, it was the parents, not Wallace, who suffered Judge Olu Stevens  wrath. I am offended.   I am deeply offended that they would be victimized by an individual and express some kind of fear of all black men,  he said. This little girl certainly has been victimized, and she can t help the way she feels,  he said.  My exception is more with her parents and their accepting that kind of mentality and fostering those type of stereotypes. The Grays were not in court as Stevens denounced their statements and granted probation to Wallace, whom he said deserved the opportunity to redeem himself.But they did see when Stevens condemned their statements again, in a post on Facebook. Do three year olds form such generalized, stereotyped and racist opinions of others?  he wrote.  I think not. Perhaps the mother had attributed her own views to her child as a manner of sanitizing them. That a supposedly unbiased judge would ask such an ridiculously biased  leading question  does not speak well of him.It s obviously true that three year olds generally don t develop  generalized, stereotyped and racist opinions (as if you could call her fears those things)  on their own.  This young tot had a little help   She was traumatized when a couple of black home invaders terrorized her family. Is this judge stupid?The family is obviously unhappy that the ordeal has negatively impacted their daughter s view of blacks. How did he miss that? It s why they listed it it on the impact statement.Later Stevens said,  I wasn t criticizing the victims, I was criticizing a statement that I thought was a generalization against an entire race of people.

Shame on him. #SMDHMeanwhile    Wallace and his accomplice, Marquis McAfee, both 27, were arrested about three weeks after the robbery. Both pleaded guilty and McAfee, who was on probation for a prior crime, was sentenced to 10 years in prison, which he is serving.Assistant Commonwealth s Attorney Richard Elder objected to probation for Wallace, who pleaded guilty to a 20-year sentence, saying he was  guilty as hell  and  put a gun in that little girl s father s face.

 George H. W. Bush Writes Letter Showing Trump How To NOT Be A Corrupt President,"Former President George H. W. Bush can teach Donald Trump a thing or two about handling conflicts of interest.As January 20th approaches, Donald Trump is apparently poised to violate the Constitution the moment he finishes reciting the oath of office because he has yet to properly eliminate the conflicts of interest between himself and his family business.Public officials are not allowed to use their office to to influence policies that would increase profits of a company they have a personal stake in. By not putting his assets, including the Trump Organization and any stocks he owns, into a blind trust or sells them off, Trump is violating the the Emoluments Clause and breaking decades of precedent.The most example is when Jimmy Carter sold the peanut business he built from the ground up to avoid conflicts of interest. Of course, Republicans initiated a series of witch hunts against Carter s business anyway in a desperate effort to find a scandal. Today, Republicans don t care if Trump continues to own his business, even though he is already using the presidency to make business deals and bring in profits.Indeed, when Ivanka Trump sat in during a meeting between her father and the Japanese Prime Minister, her company was in the middle of working on a deal with a Japanese company.As Newsweek explained,At the same time, officials with her clothing company were working on a licensing agreement with Sanei International. The largest shareholder of Sanei s parent company is the Development Bank of Japan, which is wholly owned by the Japanese government headed by Abe.Trump has also talked to the president of Taiwan and the leader of Argentina, where Trump s company is trying to secure deals to build hotels. Clearly, Trump is flagrantly using the presidency to enrich himself and his company.George H.W. Bush warned his own family not to do this or even make it appear that they are doing it by sending each family member a letter in 1988 in the midst of the presidential election.The elder Bush told his family that people are going to try to be their friend but that  friendship  could result in asking for favors simply because they are connected to the leader of the free world. If there is a legitimate inquiry, call my office,  Bush wrote.  It is certainly appropriate to contact your own government, but let s do it through my office so no one can accuse any of the family of trying to use influence. In other words, Bush told his family not to call him on their friend s behalf. They have to call his office themselves.Bush knew all too well that,  Every effort will be made to find some phone call, some inquiry, some letter that can be made to appear improper. Here s the full letter via Twitter.pic.twitter.com/60GKf4QIIJ  Eric Lipton (@EricLiptonNYT) December 21, 2016Donald Trump, however, is influenced by his business and since his children are deeply involved in the company, that means they ll have special access to him and will be able to curry favors such as asking him to gut certain regulations or asking him to call certain foreign leaders to push through business deals.That s a serious ethics violation that cannot be tolerated. Hell, Eric Trump has already been busted trying to sell access to his father in exchange for $1 million donations to his fraudulent charity. So it s pretty clear that there is already a pay-for-play scandal brewing before Trump has even taken office.This needs to stop now and the only way it will stop is if Trump sells his company or puts it into a blind trust. Anything less is unacceptable.Featured Image: Wikimedia"
LAURA INGRAHAM: GOP Senior Senators “Laughed Out Loud” At Building Border Wall…”Actively Working Against” Trump [Video],"Laura Ingraham reported to Sean Hannity that Republican leaders don t want the border wall built and are actively working against Preisdent Trump One thing I know for sure, Sean, is that we have way too many people on Capitol Hill who are not on the president s side of this. I m talking Republicans. So I have no doubt in my mind that Donald Trump wants this wall to be built. Congress has to appropriate the money. I heard over two months ago that GOP leadership, the most senior senators on Capitol Hill, and I heard it from someone who was in the room with them, they were laughing at an idea a wall would ever get built. Out loud laughing. They were recently telling that source of mine,  Don t worry, it s not going to happen. In the mean time, Lou Dobbs gives a classic take down of Paul Ryan:Yes, just get out of the way!BORDER RANCHERS VOUCH FOR BUILDING THE WALL:Fred Davis and John Ladd are two Arizona ranchers who were guests on Fox & Friends to tell their story of what its like to be on the front lines at the border:REPORT: THE COST TO YOU FOR NOT BUILDING THE WALL (Note that this report is from 2013!):The Fiscal Burden of Illegal Immigration on United States TaxpayersThis report estimates the annual costs of illegal immigration at the federal, state and local level to be about $113 billion; nearly $29 billion at the federal level and $84 billion at the state and local level.The study also estimates tax collections from illegal alien workers, both those in the above-ground economy and those in the underground economy.Those receipts do not come close to the level of expenditures and, in any case, are misleading as an offset because over time unemployed and underemployed U.S. workers would replace illegal alien workers.Key FindingsIllegal immigration costs U.S. taxpayers about $113 billion a year at the federal, state and local level. The bulk of the costs   some $84 billion   are absorbed by state and local governments.The annual outlay that illegal aliens cost U.S. taxpayers is an average amount per native-headed household of $1,117.The fiscal impact per household varies considerably because the greatest share of the burden falls on state and local taxpayers whose burden depends on the size of the illegal alien population in that localityEducation for the children of illegal aliens constitutes the single largest cost to taxpayers, at an annual price tag of nearly $52 billion. Nearly all of those costs are absorbed by state and local governments.At the federal level, about one-third of outlays are matched by tax collections from illegal aliens.At the state and local level, an average of less than 5 percent of the public costs associated with illegal immigration is recouped through taxes collected from illegal aliens.Most illegal aliens do not pay income taxes. Among those who do, much of the revenues collected are refunded to the illegal aliens when they file tax returns.Many are also claiming tax credits resulting in payments from the U.S. Treasury.With many state budgets in deficit, policymakers have an obligation to look for ways to reduce the fiscal burden of illegal migration. California, facing a budget deficit of $14.4 billion in 2010-2011, is hit with an estimated $21.8 billion in annual expenditures on illegal aliens. New York s $6.8 billion deficit is smaller than its $9.5 billion in yearly illegal alien costs.The report examines the likely consequences if an amnesty for the illegal alien population were adopted similar to the one adopted in 1986. The report notes that while tax collections from the illegal alien population would likely increase only marginally, the new legal status would make them eligible for receiving Social Security retirement benefits that would further jeopardize the future of the already shaky system.An amnesty would also result in this large population of illegal aliens becoming eligible for numerous social assistance programs available for low-income populations for which they are not now eligible. The overall result would, therefore, be an accentuation of the already enormous fiscal burden.Read more: FAIR"

ADMINISTRATORS FACE BACKLASH After Florida Middle School Organizes Segregated Field Trip For Blacks Only," We didn t mean to send a negative message. We wanted to be positive.  Yeah because telling Asians, Whites and Hispanics to stay back and do school work while their black friends go on a field trip is a pretty positive experience for everyone Administrators at a Florida middle school faced a severe backlash from parents and students after they organized a field trip only for black students.Heron Creek Middle School scheduled a trip to Black Violin, a  performance by black musicians,  WSTP reports. I think it should be the whole school not just blacks,  says black seventh-grader Richard Service.Instead, administrators were caught segregating students based on race.The school received 50 tickets and decided to give them only to black students.  They said it was for blacks to be motivated to improve their grades,  according to Service. I did think it was kind of racist that Latinos, Chinese couldn t go,  says Jennifer Bender, another student at the school. No matter what race it s wrong all the way around,  according to parent Steve Moreno.Other parents were harshly critical of the move on a community Facebook page. Linda Prince wrote:Just wanted to let the community be aware of what is happening at Heron Creek Middle School. Yesterday they called an assemble for ONLY African American students. The assembly was to tell them that they could earn a field trip for good behavior. After writing a email to the school board last night letting them know I was upset, I received a call from the vice principle this afternoon. He told me it was because there was an upcoming performance from a group called Two Black Musicians and they thought it would be a good motivational tool for their African American students. I thought segregation ended a long time ago. I completely do not agree with this. Basically I was told we just have to agree to disagree.After the backlash, administrators decided to allow all students to attend. We care about every child on this campus. We celebrate diversity all the time,  Principal Matthew Gruhl says. We didn t mean to send a negative message. We wanted to be positive,  according to Gruhl.  We learned from this,  he says, adding a bit sarcastically,  We are sorry if we hurt people s feelings. Gruhl had told students they were changing the rules not because they were caught segregating students based on race, but because,  We learned there s a demand for all our students to have an opportunity to see this great performance. They re now trying to raise $3,500 to purchase 500 tickets so more students can go, based on grades and behavior and not race. There s no word on who will go if they don t raise that amount of money. They had some parents upset this opportunity was not extended to more students,  Sarasota County schools spokesman Scott Ferguson tells the Herald-Tribune.  They decided today to open it up to all students who met the same criteria. That involves grades and behavior and other criteria. That s how should have been in the beginning,  parent Steve Moreno tells the news station. Via: EAG News"

LESTER HOLT PULLS A “Candy Crowley” 5 Times…Joins Team Hillary To Help Debate Trump,"Who won the debate tonight? Donald J. Trump or the Lester Holt-Clinton team?NBC News  Lester Holt had his  Candy Crowley  moment at the first debate of the 2016 presidential election on Monday night, bowing to pressure from the Hillary Clinton campaign and the liberal media by  fact-checking  Republican nominee Donald Trump on the question of his support for the Iraq War.Holt lived up to the expectations of his peers. But he lived down to the worst expectations of conservatives, who routinely see Republican candidates treated unfairly by debate moderators.Hillary also went over the 2 minute mark several times, while there were several times when Lester Holt would cut Donald Trump off after only having a little over a minute to answer a question. Again and again, Holt asked Trump tough questions that were straight from the Clinton campaign s talking points, and which were obvious set-ups for Clinton to attack (and for fact-checkers to pounce on whatever Trump asserted in his own defense).Here are the five worst examples.Tax returns. Holt never asked Clinton about her e-mail scandal, about Benghazi, or about the Clinton Foundation and its dubious dealings. But he did ask Trump about his tax returns, arguing   not asking   that there might be questionable information in them that the American public deserved to hear.Birther conspiracy theory. Holt never asked Clinton about her past record of racist statements, including her  super-predator  remarks as First Lady, or her explicit appeal to  white Americans  in her 2008 primary campaign against Obama. Yet he asked Trump about the Birther conspiracy theory and cast it as racist.Stop-and-frisk. After an exchange between the candidates over the policy of  stop-and-frisk,  Holt interjected to bolster Clinton s point by stating, erroneously, that stop-and-frisk had ended in New York because it had been declared unconstitutional by a court. Trump countered, correctly, that the new mayor had canceled the policy before the litigation was over. A presidential look.  Towards the end of the debate, Holt asked Trump about what he meant by saying Hillary Clinton did not have  a presidential look.  He did so after noting that Clinton had become  the first woman  to be nominated for president by a major political party, thus setting Trump up as a sexist. As Trump answered, Holt interrupted him, then gave Clinton a chance to respond with her talking points about Trump s past comments on women.Iraq War. The question of whether Trump supported the Iraq War or not has been widely debated. What is beyond doubt is that Hillary Clinton voted for it. Holt only represented one side of the debate about Trump, and never asked Clinton about her own vote. Via: Breitbart"
"OBAMA RAMPS UP Militarization Of EPA, FDA, VA While Obsessing Over Taking Guns From Citizens","Every American should be concerned and should be demanding answers from Washington about why we need to militarize these federal government agencies As the U.S. engages in a national debate over the militarization of the police, federal data shows that government agencies charged with largely administrative roles are spending tens of millions of taxpayer dollars to purchase SWAT and military-style equipment.Since FY 2006, 44 traditionally administrative agencies have spent over $71 million on items like body armor, riot helmets and shields, cannon launchers and police firearms and ammunition, according to federal spending data from watchdog group OpenTheBooks.comThis comes in addition to the $330 million spent on such equipment in that period by traditional law enforcement agencies like the FBI, Secret Service and Drug Enforcement Administration.Some examples of the purchases include:  Nearly $2 million spent by the Department of Veterans Affairs on riot helmets, defender shields, body armor, a  milo return fire cannon system,  armored mobile shields, Kevlar blankets, tactical gear and equipment for crowd control.  Over $300,000 spent by the Food and Drug Administration on  ballistic vests and carriers  in fiscal 2014. Via: Washington Times "
NO SHAME! MSNBC ANCHOR Attacks Critically Injured Steve Scalise Who Can’t Defend Himself [Video],"Joy Reid is known for her racist slant on the news. She s one bitter and angry woman we ve reported on numerous times for her over-the-top rhetoric. This latest rant is surprising even for Reid. She goes after critically injured congressman Steve Scalise with the aide of a NAACP board member. Steve Scalise cannot defend himself right now The left has no shame!Reid:  There s a whole country out there and a lot of people, at least in my Twitter timeline, and it s a delicate thing, because everybody is wishing the congressman well and hoping that he recovers, but Steve Scalise has a history that we ve all been forced to sort of ignore on race. He did come to leadership after some controversy over attending a white nationalist event, which he says he didn t know what it was. He also co-sponsored a bill to amend the Constitution to define marriage as between a man and a woman. He co-sponsored the House healthcare bill, which as you said would gut healthcare for millions of people including three million children and he cosponsored a bill to repeal the ban on semiautomatic weapons. Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise is still hospitalized in critical condition but liberal MSNBC host Joy Ann Reid didn t let that stop her from portraying Scalise as an extremist just three days after an angry left-winger shot Scalise and tried to assassinate dozens of Republican congressmen in Alexandria, Virginia on Wednesday.House Majority Whip Steve Scalise was in  imminent risk of death  when he was flown to a trauma center Wednesday after being shot during an ambush of a GOP congressional baseball team practicing on a Virginia field. He will be in the hospital for a considerable period of time, presumably weeks,  said Jack Sava, trauma director at MedStar Washington Hospital Center, who spoke Friday about the Louisiana Republican who remains in critical condition at the hospital in the District.Sava added that Scalise  was as critical as you can be when he came in  after a single rifle shot traversed his body from his left hip through internal organs to the other hip as witnesses said he was fielding ground balls.The shot fired at Scalise left perhaps hundreds of bullet fragments internally, many of which may never be removed because surgery might be more dangerous than leaving them in place, Sava said. That circumstance is not uncommon for that type of injury, known as a transpelvic gunshot wound, the trauma surgeon said.Sava said Scalise will require surgeries soon for abdominal and bone injuries, in addition to the two he has undergone to repair a bone in his leg broken by the bullet. The congressman sustained  substantial damage  to organs and blood vessels, Sava said, and remains in intensive care.How can these idiots keep arguing with a man who is critically injured in the hospital? It s horrible because he cannot defend himself! "
 Trump Supporters Terrorize An American Woman On The Subway For Wearing A Hijab,"Donald Trump s deplorable supporters strike again.18-year-old Yasmin Seweid was born in Brooklyn, New York. So she has been raised in America her entire life. She grew up surrounded by American culture and values religious freedom as guaranteed by the Constitution.And that is why she is able to wear a hijab and practice Islam.But while she was standing on the subway platform waiting to go home, three male Trump supporters targeted her and began harassing her. They called her a  terrorist,  ripped the straps on her bag, and tried to forcibly remove her hijab all while saying Trump s name.The abuse continued on the train and Seweid was forced to exit at an early stop in order to get away from them. Bystanders even watched the incident unfold and cowardly did nothing to stop it.She reported the incident to police, who are investigating the crime.In order to warn others about the dangers of Trump supporters, Seweid chose to write about her horrific experience on Facebook. I take the train every single day going to & coming from class, but yesterday, something happened that I never thought would happen to me,  Seweid wrote.  I was harassed on the subway last night and it was just so dehumanizing I can t speak about it without getting emotional. Three white racists ripped the straps off my bag & attempted to yank my hijab off my head. They yelled such disgusting slurs at me, I was so helpless and felt defenseless.  Look it s a fucking terrorist ,  go back to your country ,  take that rag off your head  and so many more. Trump s name was repeatedly said & it finally clicked in my head. No matter how  cultured  or  Americanized  I am, these people don t see me as an American.It breaks my heart that so many individuals chose to be bystanders while watching me get harassed verbally and physically by these disgusting pigs. Trump America is real and I witnessed it first hand last night! What a traumatizing night. Please stay safe everyone & never let anyone take your rights away. Just thought I should share that with you all tonight.Here s her full post via Facebook.Ever since Election Day, Trump supporters have been celebrating by committing hate crimes against women and minorities. In fact, the number of hate crimes skyrocketed and nearly 900 of them have been committed in the weeks since November 8th. And experts say it is worse than the number of hate crimes committed after the 9/11 attacks.Donald Trump has done nothing more than create an atmosphere of hate and violence in this country. With that being said, his call for unity is complete bullshit. We can t have unity in this country when his own supporters are going around terrorizing people.Featured Image: Steve Pope/Getty Images"
 Actor Martin Sheen Tells Senate GOP To Do Their Jobs When Obama Picks SCOTUS Nominee (AUDIO),"Martin Sheen channeled his President Jed Bartlett character from The West Wing to call upon voters to tell Senate Republicans to obey the Constitution.As conservative groups mobilize and begin spending massive amounts of money to keep Republicans to their word that they will refuse to even hold hearings on any of President Obama s Supreme Court nominees to fill the vacant seat Antonin Scalia leaves behind, People For The American Way is fighting back with a campaign of their own. The strategy is to use Sheen in a series of robocalls designed to urge voters to shame Republican senators from Wisconsin and Pennsylvania into doing their jobs.Specifically, the calls target Senator Ron Johnson in Wisconsin and Senator Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania. Our Constitution is very clear about what happens when a vacancy occurs of the Supreme Court,  Sheen says in the call. It says the President shall nominate a new judge and that the Senate will give that nominee a fair consideration. But as you may have heard, Republicans are playing politics with out Constitution and with the Supreme Court. Sheen then goes after Johnson for saying that he doesn t think Senate Republicans should even give a hearing to any nominee.  That s clearly irresponsible and it puts partisanship above the law,  Sheen says before asking voters to call Johnson and tell him to put his  constitutional duties first and give fair consideration to President Obama s nominee. Here s the audio of the Wisconsin robocall via Talking Points Memo.This isn t the first time Martin Sheen has urged voters to stand up for American values. In 2014, he appeared in an ad asking Kentucky voters to elect Alison Lundergan Grimes over Mitch McConnell so that Social Security and Medicare will continue to be safe and made stronger.As we all know, McConnell ended up winning another term in the Senate, which he is now using disgracefully to disobey the Constitution and politicize the Supreme Court instead of doing his job responsibly by holding confirmation hearings for whoever President Obama nominates to fill Scalia s seat.Hopefully, voters won t ignore Sheen s call this time around.

 Vicente Fox Brilliantly Trolls Trump’s Disastrous Week; It’s Glorious,"Former Mexican President Vicente Fox has never been a fan of Donald Trump. During the 2016 presidential campaign, he routinely went after Trump s disparaging remarks about Mexican immigrants, and infamously said that Mexico would not  pay for that f**king wall. Now, President Fox is using Trump s own favorite platform   Twitter   to troll him over the absolute incompetence coming out of the White House and indeed from Trump himself.  Fox, like anyone who has paid attention to Donald Trump during the campaign and since his ascent to the White House, knows that this presidential run wasn t about running the nation. It was about Donald Trump s insatiable ego, his insecurity, and his constant quest for more money and power that has been a lifelong pattern. Running for president was the only thing left. President Fox tweeted:.@realDonaldTrump, don't go all weepy on me! You've got what you wanted: you're the center of attention, but not the kind you wanted, right?  Vicente Fox Quesada (@VicenteFoxQue) May 17, 2017Indeed, it seems that Trump thought that if he got to be president, he wouldn t have to, well, govern. He likely thought he d be busy putting gold toilets in the White House, taunting Democrats, and telling big crowds of supporters how great he is.Largely, that IS what Trump is doing; after all, he held a victory tour of rallies, and held a dueling event the night of the White House Correspondents  Dinner so that he could mock the so-called  Washington elite.  And, of course, we all see his Twitter feed, which is full of mockery and ridicule.However, during all of this, we see a White House riddled with scandal after scandal of Trump s own making. The Russia investigation is heating up, and no matter how many times Trump and his supporters say it is  fake news,  it isn t going away. Even members of Trump s own Republican Party are floating the idea of impeachment. President Fox is right   Trump is getting attention, but definitely not the kind he wanted.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images"
 Comedian Russell Brand DESTROYS Trump In Hilarious Stand-Up Routine (VIDEO),"Republican front-runner Donald Trump has caused a lot of outrage since stepping into the race for the White House, and with good reason. The billionaire is the worst person to run for the highest office since white supremacist George Wallace in 1968. But for all the anger he has caused, he s also given comedians a whole lot of material. The latest comedian to capitalize on the Trump train wreck is Russell Brand and it is hilarious.Brand has long been a champion of economic and social justice in both the United States and the U.K. The comedian often speaks out about politics and once said: I have never voted. Like most people I am utterly disenchanted by politics. Like most people I regard politicians as frauds and liars and the current political system as nothing more than a bureaucratic means for furthering the augmentation and advantages of economic elites. Although, I don t agree with him not taking advantage of his right to vote in the U.K., I do agree that lots of people have become disenchanted with politics. Actually, part of the reason Donald Trump has risen to the top of the GOP race is because he isn t part of the  establishment  and his imbecilic fan club believes he is honest   but, I digress.Brand has a successful v-blog called The Trew News which has unfortunately been on hiatus for the last six months. However, on Tuesday, the comedian surprised us all by posting a short new video online where he absolutely pummels Trump. In the video titled  Trump   Pixar-Hitler or aged-baby?  Brand says: I like him cause he s like a big rich baby. I just want to breastfeed him. Come here you silly c*nt, have a bit of t*t-milk. He is like a giant, rich baby and he proves it every time he lashes out at people who do not give him what he wants. He d be a disaster for this country and everyone knows it, even comedians from other countries. We are a laughingstock all over the world thanks to him and all the dumbasses who support him.Watch the rest of Brand s remarks in his video: Featured image via Instagram"

HILLARY COULDN’T FIND 125 WOMEN TO BUY TICKETS TO ‘Women Only’ FUNDRAISER…Forced To Sell Tickets To Men,"But what about Hillary being a  formidable opponent  when it comes to women voters? Hillary Clinton had trouble attracting high-powered women to a New York talk hosted by Silda Wall Spitzer two weeks before her campaign officially kicks off. Sources said that after ticket sales fizzled for an intimate, $2,700-per-person,  just for women  meeting on Monday, the event was thrown open to men at the 11th hour, and the deadline extended to buy tickets.The  Conversation With Hillary Clinton  event at Midtown law firm Akin Gump was originally aiming to attract 125 women. An email invitation seen by Page Six said the event is  just for women.  But by Friday,  They d only sold 50 tickets, so they threw it open to men,  a source said.  Ticket sales were supposed to close at 10 a.m. Sunday, but the hostesses were working the phones and pushed the deadline till Monday. We hear about 90 attendees included former Bill Clinton aide Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney and his husband, Randy Florke, Maurice Tempelsman, Jill Braufman (wife of hedge funder Daniel Nir), Jean Shafiroff and Susan Cole. The event began at noon, but Clinton arrived at 1 p.m. in  a royal blue jacket and black pants.  She then took pictures with donors and delivered a half-hour speech before leaving at about 2 p.m.Silda introduced Clinton as a  tough, authentic leader,  which is probably more than she can say about her hard-charging ex Eliot. In a possible nod to her host, Clinton quoted Eleanor Roosevelt, quipping,  Every woman in public life needs to develop skin as tough as rhinoceros hide. Topics included  clean energy,  mental health care for college kids, keeping but  revising  ObamaCare, Vladimir Putin, and America s heroin and meth  epidemic. Meanwhile, on Monday, journalists covering Clinton met in Washington, DC, to grouse about inadequate access to the candidate. When we reached out to a local Clinton campaign rep who helped organize the event, she referred us to Clinton s deputy national press secretary, who referred us to her  rapid response spokesperson,  who, not surprisingly, had no comment.Via: NY Post"
 Hillary Clinton Did Not Send ‘Top Secret’ Emails On Private Server,"On January 29, the U.S. State Department announced that the agency had identified 37 pages of  top secret emails  among the 55,000 pages of emails contained on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton s private email server.Not surprisingly, Clinton s GOP rivals went straight to work spreading half-truths and misinformation about the announcement.As former Chair of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee Dianne Feinstein pointed out in a statement on Friday, several key facts are being left out of the narrative surrounding the announcement.For starters, the 37 pages of  top secret  communication actually involve only seven chain emails. Each of these seven emails was sent to a larger group of recipients, including the former Secretary of State.None of the  top secret emails  were sent from Hillary Clinton s private server.All of the emails originated from within the State Department s unclassified system. None of them contained the mandatory  top secret  label which is required for all classified communication.During a press conference on Friday, State Dept. spokesperson John Kirby told reporters that the emails were being withheld because they meet the definition of top secret communication now.Kirby also stressed that the emails were not marked classified at the time that they were sent. Was the information contained in the emails considered classified at the time they were sent? Keep in mind that all 55,000 of Clinton s emails were sent between March 2009 and February 2013. Since the State Department regularly raises the status of unclassified material to the level of classified, it s more than likely the content of these seven emails was not considered classified when it was sent.According to Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon,  in at least one case, the emails appear to involve information from a published news article. The last time the GOP went wild with claims that Clinton had  top secret emails  on her private server, we later found out that the information had been retroactively classified by the FBI.To summarize:In other words, this is not the huge scandal republicans were hoping for. Instead, it s just another baseless right wing attack on Hillary Clinton that falls apart under even the slightest amount of scrutiny.Featured image credit: Pixabay"
OBAMA UNDERMINES AMERICA…Plans To Slash Nuclear Stockpiles…Again,"Dinesh D Sousa warned us about Obama s reduction of our nation s nuclear stockpile in his movie,  2016, Obama s America.  Shortly after his blockbuster movie appeared in theaters across America, Dinesh D Souza was charged with violating federal campaign finance laws and was sentenced to five years of probation, a $30,000 fine, and eight months in a San Diego  community confinement center  where he was forced to undergo  therapeutic counseling. Here is what Dinesh D Souza predicted:Driven by the alleged anti-colonialist ideology of a father he barely met, President Barack Obama systematically is undermining America economically and militarily   leaving it vulnerable to financial collapse, and even as unlikely as the possibility may seem, nuclear attack.And it charges as he slashes the defense budget, Obama is simultaneously pushing to reduce the nation s nuclear stockpile to as low as a few hundred missiles   even as other countries like China, Russia and North Korea are modernizing and expanding their arsenals, and Iran   widely believed to be close to developing nuclear weapons   is threatening to annihilate Israel.   From Dinesh D Sousa s controversial 2010 book,  The Roots Of Obama s Rage   WNDHere is what is actually happening today:The United States cut its nuclear stockpiles by 20 percent between 1996 and 2013, with more reductions likely to come, according to recently declassified information released by the White House.Stockpiles of highly enriched uranium, or HEU, which is used to fuel a nuclear weapon, were cut from 740.7 metric tons to 586.6 metric tons from 1996 to 2013, according to recently declassified information made available by the Obama administration. This reflects a reduction of over 20 percent,  the White House announced.  Moreover, further reductions in the inventory are ongoing; the U.S. Department of Energy s material disposition program has down-blended 7.1 metric tons of HEU since September 30, 2013, and continues to make progress in this area. The stockpile reductions are part of an effort by the Obama administration to eliminate nuclear materials and move away from these types of weapons.The move comes as countries such as Russia and North Korea move to increase their nuclear stockpiles. Russia, for instance, has made several announcements about its intent to boost its nuclear stockpile and number of weapons.However, the United States is moving in the opposite direction.Via:WFB "

" Hillary Just Responded To Trump’s Pre-Debate Bullsh*t On Twitter, And It’s EPIC (TWEET)","After the release of the videotape showing Trump not only use derogatory language about women, but also profess to be a sexual predator, we re starting to notice the Trump campaign in a bit of tailspin.Trump s getting so desperate, in fact, that he just dragged out some women who allege they re victims of sexual abuse from Bill Clinton. What people need to remember is that, no matter if any of those allegations are true, Bill is not who is running for president. Trump is acting out of fear because he knows he s about to have his orange ass handed to him.Hillary s Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri released the official statement from the Clinton campaign regarding Trump s desperation:The statement read: We re not surprised to see Donald Trump continue his destructive race to the bottom. Hillary Clinton understands the opportunity in this town hall is to talk to voters on stage and in the audience about the issues that matter to them, and this stunt doesn t change that. If Donald Trump doesn t see that, that s his loss. As always, she s prepared to handle whatever Donald Trump throws her way. However, it was what Clinton tweeted next that shows us exactly why she will be the next President of the United States. Instead of jumping back at all the crazy that is Donald Trump, she instead tweets this:Remember. #Debate pic.twitter.com/rlMbTt5WwY  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 10, 2016Which is exactly what she will do.Donald Trump is currently self-destructing before our very eyes, and he has no idea what to do next.Hillary will stick to the issues and what s best for the nation as Trump takes the low road and tries to mudsling himself into the White House.This election has certainly been an interesting one, and something tells me it s only going to get worse before it gets better, and by  gets better  I mean, when Hillary wins on November 8th.Featured Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images"
 Here’s Why 2016 Will Be The Year Of The Woman,"Go back to 1991. Anita Hill accuses Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment just as his confirmation hearings are wrapping up. Republicans, still sour about the failed nomination of Robert Bork, decide to turn the confirmation into a media circus in an attempt to smear Hill and save their ultra-conservative zealot from being held accountable for his actions.Women in America were disgusted with what they saw   old, Republican men turning their backs on a respected women who was sexually harassed and instead blindly taking the word of their ideologue for purely partisan reasons.It was this repulsive circus show that led to the 1992 election, which was dubbed the Year of the Woman. In that very important election, as not only was President Bill Clinton elected over George H.W. Bush (who appointed Thomas), but some of the most influential women of the Senate were elected   Barbara Boxer of California, Patty Murray of Washington, and Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois.According to the House s record:In 1992, women went to the polls, energized by a record-breaking number of women on the federal ticket. The results were unprecedented; the 24 women who won election to the U.S. House of Representatives for the first time that November comprised the largest number elected to the House in any single election, and the women elected to the Senate tripled the number of women in that chamber.Women had one simple message for the GOP: they were sick and tired of sexist, old Republican men.And that is why 2016 will be the Year of the Woman. With Donald Trump as the clear cut nominee for President of the United States, there is no doubt women will come out in full force   with a clear hatred for him and his rhetoric   and send liberal women to Washington in droves.Look at the facts:According to a CNN poll from April 2016, a whopping 73 percent of women have a highly unfavorable view of Donald Trump, and it only continues to grow. Almost 40 percent of Republican women have an unfavorable view of the frontrunner. He s now the nominee for the Republican Party. The man who has referred to women as  bitches  and  dogs  is now the de facto leader of a major American political party.There are a historical amount of strong and competitive women running for the Senate this election season:Republicans fear that the Trump nomination could cost them the Senate. And with women as the Democratic nominees for many of the most competitive races this season, things are looking good for another Year of the Woman.If Democrats vote down ticket (which thy usually do in presidential elections), Democrats take back the Senate with the help of eight qualified ladies.With dozens of House races being ran by progressive women, Congress could and will look vastly different   of Democrats want it to be. All they have to do is vote. They just have to get out and vote.And with Hillary Clinton inching her way to the presidential nomination, it looks as though women will have more control than ever before, and that s absolutely a good thing.Women have one of strongest voices in the American electorate. In 1992, they were pissed and rightfully so. In 2016, the sentiments are the exact same. Nancy Pelosi and Elizabeth Warren are taking Donald Trump to task everyday for his sexist, dangerous rhetoric. Women are fired up, and they won t be quiet or sit this one out.I want women to decide this election. They ve been picked on enough.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images"

HOLLYWOOD BLVD: PRO-TRUMP #Oscar Rally Gets Ugly When Punches Start Flying…Trump Hating Female Picks On WRONG Woman! [VIDEO],"Dozens of supporters of US President Donald Trump rallied on the Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles, Saturday, a day ahead of the Academy Awards ceremony, in order to defend the president and protect his star on the Walk of Fame.One arrest was made after clashes erupted as some by-passers confronted the protesters, breaking one of their placards. Protesters campaigned for Trump to build the wall at the southern US border with Mexico and displayed signs such as  Mexicans for Trump,   California for Trump  and  women for Trump. Watch:The organizer of the rally Matthew Woods stressed that Trump supporters are  boycotting many actors and film directors who have an anti-America agenda. A few of the pro-Trump supporters who were present at the rally explained why they supported him: I m Latino and I say,  build that wall.  These illegal immigrants. I actually have a friend whose son was killed by an illegal immigrant. They re losing and it s the price they re going to pay. They re losing support of the arts and the films. We re boycotting many actors and film that have an anti-American agenda, a globalist agenda or an anti-Trump agenda. "
“You’re Not Welcome!” Obama As Welcome At Roseberg Funerals As Westboro Baptist Church Members [Videos],"Roseberg residents and families of victims are speaking out against Obama and are repulsed by his obvious desire to use the deaths and injuries of their loved ones to promote his leftist agenda. Of course, he s going anyhow. It is of no consequence to him that basically the whole town wants him to stay away. Keep it classy Barry Maybe the Roseberg residents should make the same kind of human chain between Barack and the cameras that they do around the Westboro Baptist  Church  members at funerals Roseberg residents and even relatives of victims are telling Barack Obama to stay home and don t come here to dance on the graves of our loved ones.  You re not welcome! Tomorrow President Obama is scheduled to visit Rosenburg, Oregon, where 10 people were killed last week at Umpqua Community College by a deranged killer who happened to use a gun to carry out his crimes.We ve already reported on the repulsed reaction from the community as people who live there continue to reject Obama s visit. Now Stacy Boylan, the father of shooting victim Ana Boylan, is directly speaking out against Obama s visit and has no interest in putting up with his exploitation of the tragedy for political purposes. I do believe it was Rahm Emanuel who said  Never let a good tragedy go to waste,  and I really feel that his [Obama] visit here is to completely to support his gun control agenda. I can t understand why he wouldn t make a mention of the families and the victims. I mean, he did say that it was a tragic incident and I do thank him for lowering the flags but he made it all about gun control. He was very clear about that and we saw this in Sandy Hook and now we re seeing it again and I just question his motives,  Boylan said.  I ve spoken to my family and for myself and for my family, my daughter and son, on principle I find that we are in disagreement with his policies on gun control and therefore we will not be attending the visit. My position on this is that gun free zones are an issue, they re a target for crazy people because they know they re not going to be met with resistance. You know, my daughter said to me,  What if somebody would have had a gun?  Gun free and gun control takes that option off the table. Somebody doesn t have to use their gun in defense, but to take that option entirely, I don t think that s the right course,  he continued. Via: Townhall On Monday, David Jacques, publisher of the Roseburg Beacon, appeared on a Fox News segment with Bill O Reilly.He made it clear President Obama was not welcome in Roseburg and certainly not to crash the funerals of those killed in the Umpqua Community College mass shooting by using it for his own liberal agenda.https://youtu.be/F-fS9SBLTGkVia: Downtrend"
BREAKING EMAIL LEAK: “Bernie needs to be ground to a pulp…Crush him as hard as you can”,"Hey Bernie how s that whole Queen of Wall Street/ Democrat mob boss endorsement working out for you?Wikileaks has released another batch of emails. One of those emails is likely from Joel Johnson, the Managing Director of The Glover Park Group, a Washington DC firm specializing in strategic communications and government relationsThe email was sent on Feb. 2, 2016 to John Podesta with the subject matter: Friendly advice. No mercy. From:Joel@gpg.com To: john.podesta@gmail.com Date: 2016-02-22 00:09 Subject: Friendly advice. No mercy.Bernie needs to be ground to a pulp. We can t start believing our own primary bullshit. This is no time to run the general. Crush him as hard as you can. Other than that, hope all is well and congrats on Nevada!Only 4 days ago, The Hill named GPG s Joel Johnson as one their  Top Lobbyists  or  Hired Guns  for 2016:Joel Johnson, The Glover Park GroupClients have a trusted guide in Johnson, a former Clinton administration official who leads the advocacy efforts of the public relations powerhouse.Buzzfeed   In September 2015, Susan Brophy, managing director of the Glover Park Group, emailed top Clinton aide Cheryl Mills on Oct. 4, 2011, telling her that a planned speech before a joint session of Congress by the Korean president was running into some hurdles. Brophy suggested that the State Department could move things along in Congress.The only problem was, Brophy was representing a country she wasn t registered to represent.Foreign Agent Registration Act rules require individual lobbyists to register the clients they represent, and lobbying firms are required to file their contacts on behalf of those clients.Brophy is a former Clinton White House official, and has raised money for Ready for Hillary, a pro-Clinton super PAC that shut down when the former secretary of state announced her presidential campaign. The Clintons attended her wedding to lawyer and diplomat Gerald McGowan in 1998.The speech by then-president Lee Myung-bak did proceed and took place on Oct. 13, 2011.Joel Johnson, a managing director for Glover Park Group, told BuzzFeed News that Brophy had in fact been on the team working on the South Korean account and that she should have been listed as doing so in their FARA documents. She absolutely was working on the account and had been throughout, and the fact that she had somehow not been listed directly as the principal working on the account was an administrative error,  Johnson said.Johnson also said that Brophy  should have reported that that contact had been made to the State Department and for whatever reason that was not included in our list of activities and it should have been, and I ll go back and make sure we do whatever is appropriate to amend that. Blah blah blah Is anyone else sick and tired of the Clinton s and anyone attached to the Clinton s not having to follow the same rules and laws the rest of America is expected to follow, or face the consequences of our actions? We take these reporting requirements seriously and we are as diligent as we ever can be, but in that case there s no question that the email she sent to [Mills] have been included  in the list of contacts Glover Park Group had made on behalf of South Korea, he said.Yep So are we to believe you took Grounding  Bernie to a pulp  seriously?

SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN Tries To Trash Republicans With Latest Tweet…But It’s What’s Sitting On Her Desk That Has Everyone Laughing,"Democrat Senator and fake Indian Elizabeth Warren took to Twitter to criticize the evil Republican s plan to replace Obamacare.While her tweet in and of itself, is just more of what we expect from the Democrats, it s what s sitting on a side table next to her coffee maker that has everyone laughing.I'm reading the latest way that Senate Republicans plan to rip health care away from millions of people.

Of course, any sane person who follows the biased and very fake news network CNN shouldn t be surprised to see their new favorite Democrat sporting their mug in her Senate office. We d like to offer a special  thank you  and  well done  to @TheALX who, according to his profile, lives in fake Indian Elizabeth WArren s home state of  Massachusetts.Looks like @SenWarren is a friend to @CNN just like Hillary!

 WATCH: Texas Judge Orders Newly Sworn-In Citizens To Accept Trump Or Leave The Country,"Demanding allegiance to a head of state as a condition for becoming a citizen sounds like something a dictator would do.And that s exactly what a Texas judge did during a swearing-in ceremony for immigrants who have been waiting to become citizens of the United States.John Primono is a federal judge who has sworn in over 100,000 new citizens during his career. But the election of Donald trump has apparently emboldened him to violate all sense of judicial ethics and human decency to warn new citizens that they better accept Trump as their president or else. I can assure you that whether you voted for him or you did not vote for him, if you are a citizen of the United States, he is your president,  Primono told the new citizens as they were forced to listen.  He will be your president, and if you do not like that, you need to go to another country. Here s the video via KENS.This is a pretty damn disgraceful thing to say to a group of people who clearly want to be Americans, especially from a federal judge.And Primono is paying the price for his partisanship because he was removed from presiding over any future citizenship ceremonies by the U.S. District judges.Of course, conservatives are very pleased and have made Primono their new hero, which alone should force him off the bench because it is clear that he is unable to exercise good judgement and political neutrality.But Primono claimed that he was merely offering a message of  unity  and that his remarks were taken out of context. I would never say anything like that,  Primono told KENS.  I wasn t trying to say anything for or against Donald Trump. I was just trying to say something hopeful and unifying, and unfortunately it was taken out of context. Yeah, that s complete bullshit. Telling new American citizens to support Trump or else is not  unifying.  It s a threatening message designed to scare immigrants into blindly following Trump.Immigrants should not have to deal with such threats in this country, where we have the right to political dissent. And the way Trump has treated immigrants over the last year and half makes it clear that he doesn t respect them. He hates them. So it s understandable that immigrants would be opposed to Trump s presidency. But they are not alone. Americans overwhelmingly voted against Donald Trump but he somehow won via the electoral vote. Millions of Americans are protesting against Trump and his bigotry.On a day when this group of diverse people finally became American citizens, this federal judge marred the ceremony by invoking the name of a divisive hatemonger and literally ordered them to accept Trump as their leader. It should never have happened but it makes one wonder how many more judges are going to become emboldened to behave similarly once Trump takes over in January.Featured image: Alex Wong/Getty Images"
PERFECT! President Trump Is Laughing Hysterically In HILARIOUS New Video Featuring CNN Logo As Jim Carrey In “LIAR LIAR” Movie,"Last week, after President Trump retweeted a hilarious WWE wrestling video featuring  Donald Trump  body-slamming WWE Chairman Vince McMahon, with a CNN logo dubbed over his head. Instead of letting it go, CNN chose instead, to threaten the person who allegedly created the meme. As it turns out, threatening to  out  a private citizen for exercising his right to free speech, simply because it offended CNN, probably wasn t a very good idea. #VeryFakeNews has been getting hammered on social media ever since, and their ratings are have plummeted as a result.A couple of days ago, we posted a hilarious meme depicting CNN s president Jeff Zucker, who seems to have made it his mission to destroy President Trump, as Hitler.

DID HILLARY Just Lose Her “Get Out Of Jail Free” Card?…Senior Trump Advisor: “Trump Has Not Ruled Out Criminal Probe” Against Hillary,"A senior Donald Trump adviser is calling Hillary Clinton s decision to join a recount effort  incredible  and noting that the president-elect has not ruled out pursuing a criminal investigation into his former Democratic rival.Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway told CNN s  State of the Nation  that Trump has not ruled out a criminal probe into Clinton s use of a private email server as secretary of state, even though Trump recently indicated he d rather not do so.Conway said,  He s been incredibly gracious and magnanimous to Secretary Clinton at a time when, for whatever reason, her folks are saying they will join in a recount to try to somehow undo the 70-plus electoral votes that he beat her by. She added,  The idea that we are going to drag this out now where the president-elect has been incredibly magnanimous to the Clintons and to the Obamas is pretty incredible. Trump took to Twitter Sunday morning to condemn the Green-Party backed recount effort as  a scam.

ESPIONAGE ACT VIOLATION? HILLARY EXPOSES Names Of Hidden Intelligence Officials In Emails Through “Gross Negligence”,"America keeps waiting for word that Hillary will be indicted. Is Obama waiting for the right moment or will the FBI be allowed to do their job and put Hillary behind bars? Are Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren standing by in the wings? One thing we know for sure, with this corrupt administration, anything could happen. Obama seems to have mastered the art of punishing America. Will the most corrupt President to ever occupy our White House, be the one responsible for finally putting end to the Clinton Crime Syndicate or does she know too much?Hillary Clinton posted and shared the names of concealed U.S. intelligence officials on her unprotected email system. Federal records reveal that Clinton swapped these highly classified names on an email account that was vulnerable to attack and was breached repeatedly by Russia-linked hacker attempts. These new revelations   reminiscent of the Valerie Plame scandal during George W. Bush s tenure   could give FBI investigators the evidence they need to make a case that Clinton violated the Espionage Act by mishandling national defense information through  gross negligence. Numerous names cited in Clinton s emails have been redacted in State Department email releases with the classification code  B3 CIA PERS/ORG,  a highly specialized classification that means the information, if released, would violate the Central Intelligence Act of 1949.The State Department produced a document to Judicial Watch in April 2014 that identifies different types of  (b)(3)  redactions, including  CIA PERS/ORG,  which it defines as information  Specifically exempted from disclosure by statute   Central Intelligence Act of 1949. That s what it suggests,  Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton told Breitbart News, referring to the indication that Clinton disclosed the names of CIA-protected intelligence sources, based on the B3 redactions.The CIA justifies  (b)(3)  redactions with this description:  (b)(3) Applies to the Director s statutory obligations to protect from disclosure intelligence sources and methods, as well as the organization, functions, names, official titles, salaries, or numbers of personnel employed by the Agency, in accord with the National Security Act of 1947 and the CIA Act of 1949, respectively. The State Department declined to comment.  Per the colleague who handles this issue, we are not speaking to the content of emails,  State Department spokeswoman Nicole Thompson told Breitbart News.Here are some examples of (b)(3) redactions;Naming the defense attach  in MaltaOn October 16, 2011, recent U.S. Ambassador to Malta Douglas Kmiec sent an email to Cheryl Mills with the subject line  TIME SENSITIVE AND CONFIDENTIAL   Malta Trip Backgrounder for the Secretary   Confidential. Kmiec wrote to Mills,  I know from current events that your life must be a whirlwind. I know that if there ever was someone who could tame the whirlwind, it would be you. Just read the news report of the Secretary s stop in Malta next week. Thank you for arranging this. This letter and the accompanying clips I believe will help make the Secretary s visit a highly successful and well received one. In the memo, Kmiec revealed the name of a top defense attach  in the country. That name was later classified by the State Department with three different classifications: 1.4 (D) to connote  Foreign relations or foreign activities of the US, including confidential sources,  B1 to connote  Information specifically authorized by an executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy,  and  B3 CIA PERS/ORG. The largest part of our US team in the embassy is the navy/coast guard/ ncis contingent that has established a Maritime training program with the AFM to good success. The defense attach  there now is new [REDACTED] beloved and hardworking   and to good effect, patrolling the waters and the ports for [illegible] traffickers and terror related figures,  Kmiec wrote.Mills forwarded the memo directly to Clinton s private email account at clintonemail.com with the note  Fyi background. Clinton replied to Mills and CC ed Huma Abedin with the confidential information, writing,  I need enough time there to meet. Hague is there today and doing all the right meetings. So, I m copying Huma to reinforce my desire to squeeze more out of a too quick trip. When he sent the memo to Mills, Douglas Kmiec had been out of his Ambassador to Malta job for several months. Kmiec was a big supporter of President Obama. He garnered criticism in a 2011 inspector general report for ignoring directives from Washington and for spending too much time writing articles about religion. Iran Insights On September 2, 2009, Jackie Newmyer of Long Term Strategy Group in Cambridge, Massachusetts sent an email directly to Clinton s private account with the subject line  Iran Insights From [Redacted]  that included the B3 redaction code:Secretary Clinton,Last week I traveled to Israel [REDACTED] in an Iran-related seminar and simulation exercise with the IDF general who is likely to become Israel s next chief of military intelligence and his team and, separately, [REDACTED]. Yesterday, [REDACTED] Iran workshop in Washington involving DoD and think tank experts. Despite the fact that the meetings were with defense [REDACTED] personnel, there was universal sentiment that a strike on Iran s nuclear facilities would be counterproductive, on the one hand, and that incremental measures would be perceived by Iran as an indication of weakness, on the other.The email included sensitive information including the following:If Iran acquires a nuclear capability, no single American/allied countermeasure will be adequate. Something like the  flexible response  posture from the Cold War will be required, necessitating a range of actions from enhancing the US deterrent presence   nuclear submarines carrying ballistic missiles in the Arabian Sea   to bolstering regional actors  defenses.Israeli leaders should be able to contain the damage to the Israeli population s morale from an Iranian bomb, but this will require careful management of public statements. There is a tension between building up support for action against the Iranian nuclear program now and delivering the kind of reassurance that will be necessary once the capability has been acquired.Clinton replied that she would like to discuss the matter with Jackie.Jackie replied:I will be in Washington for a day-long meeting on Thursday this week [B3 REDACTED] and my travel plans are flexible, so I could meet you any time on Wednesday afternoon, after 5 pm on Thursday, or any time on Friday morning. If those times do not work, I would be happy to come down at your convenience.Clinton and Jake Sullivan then set up a meeting with Jackie.For entire story: Breitbart News "
 One Person On Hillary’s Shortlist For VP Was Just Removed From DNC Speaker Schedule,"It you re into puzzles and figuring stuff out, you ve been loving the past few weeks trying to figure out who the vice presidential picks for either major party will be. Now that we know Indiana Gov. Mike Pence is Donald Trump s pick, we re now left to sift through clues to figure out who Hillary Clinton will give the nod too.Well, one huge clue was given when Elizabeth Warren showed up at Hillary Clinton s Washington D.C. home today, but an ever bigger clue has come as Warren s name appears to no longer be on the speaking schedule for the Democratic National Convention.Originally slotted to speak as the keynote speaker on Monday night of the convention, Warren s name is now missing.According to Politico, this is the schedule as it stands now:Monday:  First Lady Michelle Obama, Senator Bernie Sanders and DREAMer Astrid Silva Gavel time expected at 3:00 p.m.Tuesday:  President Bill Clinton Gavel time expected at 4:00 p.m.Also scheduled Tuesday are Mothers of the Movement members Gwen Carr, Mother of Eric Garner; Sybrina Fulton, Mother of Trayvon Martin; Maria Hamilton, Mother of Dontr  Hamilton; Lucia McBath, Mother of Jordan Davis; Lezley McSpadden, Mother of Michael Brown; Cleopatra Pendleton-Cowley, Mother of Hadiya Pendleton; Geneva Reed-Veal, Mother of Sandra Bland.Wednesday:  President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden Gavel time expected at 4:30 p.m.Thursday:  Hillary Clinton and Chelsea Clinton Gavel time expected at 4:30 p.m.Very interesting indeed.Noticeably also missing are other members on Clinton s shortlist for vice president, such as Sherrod Brown and Tim Kaine, but seeing as Warren was scheduled to speak, and now isn t, it could be very, very telling.Now that Trump has rounded out his ticket with Mike Pence, a man who represents the only group Trump has yet to openly hate   the LGBT community   it s looking pretty good for Clinton come November, and hopefully whoever she picks as her VP will round out the ticket nicely.Featured image via Jessica Kourkounis/Getty Images"

" Exclusive: Interview With Progressive Superstar Running For Congress, Zephyr Teachout","Before Senator Bernie Sanders popularized stepping up to the Democratic establishment, which has been overrun by corporate and big money influences, Zephyr Teachout made waves in New York State by challenging Democratic incumbent, Governor Andrew Cuomo, to a primary race in 2014. Despite being heavily out funded by Governor Cuomo, who received millions of dollars in campaign contributions from corporations and wealthy interests, Ms. Teachout received 34 percent of the vote, including winning many counties in the state, including Albany County, home of the state s capital. Although she lost, her campaign, the first she ever ran, was a blow to the myth that elected officials, particularly incumbents, are invincible in elections from their own political party.In January 2016, Ms. Teachout, currently as Associate Law Professor at Fordham University, announced she is running for New York s 19th Congressional District seat. I m running to raise up the voice that people have been shut out of politics. I think you can see across the political spectrum people are really frustrated by congress, and by politics that are increasingly driven by big money,  said Ms. Teachout in a phone interview.Ms. Teachout cited as one of the broad issues she plans to tackle in congress, is campaign finance reform, especially in regards to overturning the SCOTUS Citizens United ruling in 2010. I ve already been working in the last several years to promote Congressman John Sarbanes  (D-MD) bill, which is basically modeled off of the public financing system in New York City,  she said.  Congress unfortunately is trapped by congress members having to spend 50 percent of their time raising money. A public financing system like what Congressman Sarbanes has proposed, The Government by The People Act, would allow congress members to raise money from small donors and still have enough to reach all the voters. I think shutting down the revolving door between lobbyists and government is essential. In tandem to the issue of campaign financing being overhauled by corporations, the Trans-Pacific Partnership has received a lot of criticism from Republicans, Independents, and Democrats, including Ms. Teachout, for heavily favoring corporations and handing to them unprecedented leverage over governments. The TPP is a continuation of NAFTA ad even worse than NAFTA,  said Ms. Teachout.  Instead of changing direction and building towards a 21st century trade policy, the TPP doubles down on failed trade policy. Negotiations over Trans-Pacific Partnership between the United States and 11 other countries began during the Bush administration, and has been pushed by the Obama administration. Both Democratic Presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton, and Bernie Sanders have opposed the agreement, while Republican Presidential Candidates have expressed mixed feelings over it, with Donald Trump and Ted Cruz against it, but Governor Kasich in favor. Ms. Teachout added: I m actually quite hopeful we are going to stop it. I think a year ago you would have said  the big guns have this locked down , but there has been a truly extraordinary swelling of grassroots energy from Republicans, Democrats, and Independents all across the board against it. People are saying this is the wrong direction, we actually want more made in America, we want to buy locally owned goods and we want to be making law through a democratic process. One of the real problems of the TPP for me is it shuts you out of the process, and that is fundamental. Instead of making policy through congress which has its own problems, its making policy in the backroom, and that s no way to make international or basic economic policy in our country. New York s 19th Congressional District includes Sullivan, Ulster, Delaware, Otsego, Schoharie, Greene and Columbia Counties and parts of Montgomery, Rensselaer and Dutchess Counties. Current Representative of the district, Republican Chris Gibson announced he is retiring, leaving the seat wide open. Ms. Teachout is currently a favorite to win, she won almost every county in the district against Governor Cuomo in 2014. In the Democratic Primaries, she faces challenges from John Kehoe, a 29-year-old self-described moderate Democrat who runs a recording studio in the Hudson Valley, and Will Yandik, a town councilman from Columbia County, though popular consensus in the district s local Democratic Parties favor Ms. Teachout, according to the Poughkeepsie Journal.The Democratic Primaries take place on June 28th, 2016. On the Republican side, it will be a toss-up mainly between Andrew Heaney, a small businessman and graduate from Harvard Business School, and John Faso, a former New York State Assemblyman. Mr. Faso, who has hired Bill O Reilly as a communications consultant, has criticized Heaney for donating to President Obama s 2008 campaign. Mr. Heaney has also been accused of illegally coordinating with a Super-Pac he created, the New York Jobs Council.As progressivism has made its mark on the 2016 presidential election from the popularity of Senator Bernie Sanders  campaign, it has inspired progressive candidates across the country to run for office on similar platforms. Ms. Teachout s advice for those progressive candidates who are standing up to make their mark in a primary against an establishment backed candidate, as she did in 2014 against Governor Andrew Cuomo; spend as much time as you can on the ground listening to people, not in a closed room listening to donors. There s an extraordinary strength in the deep American grassroots and it s pretty exciting to see what could happen if you put a lot more trust in people. Featured image via Flickr"
[VIDEO] DOES SEEING TWO NAKED LESBIANS IN BED TOGETHER MAKE YOU WANT TO EAT YOGURT? Chobani Apparently Thinks It Does,"It s a shame really when a company who produces a really great product is more driven by their desire to promote a perverted social message than to actually promote their product. My husband thanks you Chobani, because of your decision to shove your brand of  diversity  down our throats, he ll have 20 less cartons of Chobani yogurt to shift around in our refrigerator every week. Greek yogurt brand Chobani debuted the latest television spot for its Simply 100 yogurt on Monday, with a surprise twist at the end in the closing seconds of the ad, the couple eating yogurt in bed are revealed to be lesbians.Created by ad agency Opperman Weiss, the 30-second spot, part of the brand s new seven-part  Love This Life  campaign, features a naked woman eating Chobani yogurt in bed next to her partner. The woman leans over and tickles her partner s foot, then seductively slides off the bed as the brand s new slogan appears onscreen.Chobani CMO Peter McGuiness told ad industry magazine AdWeek that using a lesbian couple in the spot was a  natural progression  for the new campaign. The campaign hopes to highlight a  series of modern American stories that connect the brand s values to its fans  values. For us, it s why not [feature a same-sex couple]   not why,  McGuiness told AdWeek.  There s nothing new here, per say. Inclusion and equality has been and is foundational and fundamental to the company. Chobani is the latest brand to include same-sex couples in its advertising. In January, luxury jewelry outlet Tiffany & Co. introduced its first-ever spot featuring a gay couple getting engaged. Other brands featuring same-sex couples in its ads include Wells Fargo and clothing retailer Gap.Television advertising represents something of a new frontier for the LGBT movement. Of course, television itself has exploded with critically-acclaimed programming featuring gay and transgender characters.Bruce Jenner, who came out as a woman last month on a now-infamous Vanity Fair magazine cover, is set to star in I Am Cait, a new eight-part docu-series about living as a transgender woman premiering this summer on the E! network. Fourteen-year-old transgender high-schooler Jazz Jennings will also get her own reality show, All That Jazz, on TLC this summer. Those shows are just the first in an expected bump in transgender-themed reality television programming.Transgender actor Laverne Cox earned an Emmy nomination for the Netflix prison series Orange is the New Black, while Jeffrey Tambor picked up a Golden Globe for his role as transitioning father Maura Pfefferman in Amazon s Transparent, which itself won Best Television Series honors at this year s Globes.Over on network television, Jussie Smollet portrays Jamal Lyon, the gay son of a hip-hop mogul on Empire, the biggest show on TV last season. And in March, ABC Family s The Fosters made history by airing the youngest-ever same-sex kiss between two 13-year-old boys.Via: Breitbart NewsBelow, you will find the message I sent to Chobani. Please feel free to send your own message to this address: www.care.chobani.comHave you lost your mind? What were you thinking when you produced a commercial for your high quality yogurt featuring two naked lesbian women in bed? I have a few large social media sites, and as I sit writing about your choice to place your social messaging above your product, I realize that the 20-25 cartons of Chobani I buy for myself and my three athletic daughters will be the last Chobani yogurt I buy. When my girls ask me  why?  I will have to explain to them that you have chosen to push a minority lifestyle on everyday Americans with no regard for how it may affect the young children and traditional families who purchase your product. I have nothing against gay relationships, I do however, have something against a company who I have been so loyal to for so long, choosing to push a lifestyle on America that we simply don t want pushed on us. My husband will be happy, as he ll have more room in the fridge to keep his beer cold, because I will now be buying the large containers of Fage yogurt and adding my own fruit. So long Chobani! I hope your message was worth the backlash you will certainly receive. You ve pushed the envelope too far this time Here is their emailed response(inlcuding the name of the respondent as well as his phone number: Hey, Patty.Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us about our newest  Love This Life  commercial.We launched our  Love This Life  campaign in May to reflect our fans and celebrate the role that natural food plays in their lives.As part of our founding mission to make better food for more people, inclusiveness is at the heart of our company. We re proud that our products are enjoyed by all and celebrate that diversity.Since our founding, we ve always believed in honesty and authenticity in everything we do.

 Chelsea Handler Gets The Last Word After RNC Chair Attacks Hillary For Not Smiling (VIDEO),"There may be a few women out there who enjoy a man telling them to be more joyous in their presence, but as for the rest of us, there s nothing a woman hates more than being told to smile.Do men smile all the time? No. Because if they did, we d think they were crazy and up to something. Same goes for women.Not every situation calls for a smile at all times. Especially when discussing foreign policy and our military. So, when RNC Chair Reince Priebus thought it appropriate to criticize Hillary Clinton for not smiling enough during the NBC forum hosted by Matt Lauer, it didn t exactly go over well.One person who definitely had a lot to say about Priebus and his request of a smile from Hillary was none other than Chelsea Handler on her hit Netflix show Chelsea.Chelsea began by asking Priebus: Who the f*ck are you to tell someone to smile? Adding: This is just another example of how men feel the can belittle every woman in the world and order up a smile. Chelsea then said: Stop telling women to smile. We don t like that. It s not an icebreaker, it s a deal breaker. Going for Priebus  jugular, Chelsea absolutely destroys him and his ridiculously corny smile, then says: You know when women will smile? When Hillary kicks that pneumonia and trounces Trump in November. And that s exactly right.Watch the full video here:Featured image via video screen capture"
Pay Off: The Establishment Rewards Comey with $2 million Book Deal,"21st Century Wire says For his role in helping to sow chaos in the US political system and for promulgating the official conspiracy theory that Russia somehow  hacked  the US electoral process helping Donald Trump to win last November, and also ensuring that no charges were brought anywhere near the Clintons   former FBI Director James Comey has just received the first of many gifts from the Establishment.James Comey is no stranger to elite circles, and is clearly regarded by those at the top as  a safe pair of hands. As 21WIRE reported last year, James Comey served on the board of banking giant HSBC   the same bank that was convicted of international drugs and terrorism money laundering, as well as a bank which was closely linked to the corrupt Clinton Foundation. After working fellow lawyers Eric Holder and Lorretta Lynch to stage manage the public fall out from revelations about HSBC s epic criminal enterprise, and their subsequent slap on the wrist, Comey was then rewarded by President Obama when he was appointed head of the FBI in 2013.By anyone s measure, Comey was central to the mess which has resulted from the political circus surrounding the establishment s efforts to derail the Trump campaign, and  now through the Trump presidency.Congratulations. You got your book deal. You ve made it James AP/The GuardianThe former FBI director James Comey has signed a $2m ( 1.5m) deal for a book about leadership and decision-making that will draw on his career in government, which included the high-profile drama leading up to his sacking from Donald Trump s administration.According to the publisher, Comey will tell how he handled the bureau s probe into Hillary Clinton s private email server and the allegations of ties between Russia and Trump s presidential campaign.Trump sacked Comey as FBI chief in May, later telling NBC News that he was angered by the FBI s investigation into  this Russia thing , which he insists is a fake story. Comey has since testified before Congress that Trump asked him to end an investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael T Flynn and kept memos about his meetings with the president.The book was acquired by Flatiron, an Macmillan imprint, which promises that Comey will cite  examples from some of the highest-stakes situations in the past two decades of US government . It will also  share yet unheard anecdotes from his long and distinguished career .The book is currently untitled and scheduled for publication next spring. Throughout his career, James Comey has had to face one difficult decision after another, as he has served the leaders of our country,  Flatiron said in a statement.  His book promises to take us inside those extraordinary moments in our history, showing us how these leaders have behaved under pressure. By doing so, Director Comey will give us unprecedented entry into the corridors of power, and a remarkable lesson in leadership itself.

 Senate Democrats FORCE GOP To Reveal How They’ll F*CK Americans Over During Midnight Vote,"It seems that in some ways at least, Congress doesn t quite know what to do with itself now that they ve got control of absolutely everything at the federal level. Senate Democrats seem to know that and have been using it to force Republicans to vote for things they might not otherwise vote for out of fear of pissing off their constituents.Last night, and into this morning, in fact, the Democrats of the Senate forced the GOP s hand on healthcare. No, they didn t force Republicans to admit they want to destroy Obamacare   we already know that. They engaged in a  vote-a-rama  of sorts to force Republicans to vote to gut things that their constituents will hate. They forced Republicans to admit that they re perfectly fine gutting Medicare, Medicaid, mental healthcare, women s healthcare, and more.How did they do it? They engaged in a  vote-a-rama,  in which they presented a series of amendments to a budget resolution intended to allow Congress to repeal Obamacare with simple majorities in both houses.Every one of those amendments failed. Quelle surprise, though.Several Democrats in the Senate made a point of voicing their objections as they cast their  no  votes on the budget resolution measure. For instance, Sen. Claire McCaskill (R-Missouri) said,  Because there is no replace, I vote no. The vote-a-rama lasted nearly seven hours, and included not only Democratic amendments to protect Medicare and Medicaid, but also, late Wednesday evening, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said: Put this irresponsible and rushed repeal plan aside. Work with us Democrats on a way to improve health care in America, not put chaos in place of affordable care. Mitch McConnell, however, had his own statement to issue when the vote was complete: The Senate just took an important step toward repealing and replacing Obamacare by passing the resolution that provides the legislative tools necessary to actually repeal this failed law while we move ahead with smarter health care policies. Republicans have never actually been able to point to anything that proves the ACA (which, yes, is Obamacare) is a failed policy. Does it have problems? Yes. Name one thing that doesn t, though, especially a program this complex that s only in its fledgling years.But repealing Obamacare means so much more than just ending a so-called  failed  law. It means harming millions of people in pursuit of a political goal   one that their constituents don t believe will hurt them because they literally think that Obamacare and the Affordable Care Act are two different things.Republicans don t care about collateral damage, though. They got their repeal measure through over and above the efforts of Democrats to stop it. But stopping it wasn t the Democrats  only objective. They seemed to know that, if they couldn t stop this, they could either embarrass Republicans with their votes, or force them to admit to things they don t want to admit to.Photo of Chuck Schumer by Win McNamee/Getty Images.

 WHOA! Donald Trump Is Going To Lose His F*cking Mind When He Sees SNL’s Cold Open (VIDEO),"Saturday Night Live has been mocking Donald Trump mercilessly week after week. But tonight, Alec Baldwin went no holds barred and gave his most brutal (and hilarious) performance yet.The skit spoofed Trump s interview with Lester Holt and from start to finish, they nailed Trump to the wall. The scariest part about the beginning of this hilarious segment was that when it came to the serious issues, the punchline is that this isn t really fiction.SNL started off with Trump s firing of FBI Director James Comey, which everybody knows was over Russia. And things got harsher from there. Everything was on the table, from Paul Ryan s ass kissing to Trump s teeny weeny, there was no holding back.Trust me, you don t want to miss this one.

WIKILEAKS EMAIL SHOWS CLINTON FOUNDATION FUNDS Used For Lavish Wedding Of “Spoiled Brat” Chelsea Clinton,"An email released by WikiLeaks on Sunday appears to show a former top aide to Bill Clinton arguing that an investigation into Clinton Foundation spending would show that Chelsea Clinton used foundation resources for her own wedding.The email, stolen from Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta and published by WikiLeaks, shows a back-and-forth between Podesta and Doug Band, a former aide to Bill Clinton.Band said he heard that Chelsea Clinton was  conducting an internal investigation of money within the foundation from cgi [Clinton Global Initiative] to the foundation.  He said he was hearing more  chatter  about how Chelsea was talking about internal issues like that, and said it was  not smart. In a later follow-up to Podesta, Band wrote,  The investigation into her getting paid for campaigning, using foundation resources for her wedding and life for a decade, taxes on money from her parents I hope that you will speak to her and end this,  Band added.  Once we go down this road Other emails showed Band feuding with Chelsea Clinton. For instance, Clinton had warned that Band was using Bill Clinton s name without his consent to win clients to his firm, and Band replied by saying Chelsea was a  spoiled brat kid. Via: WE"
SEWER WORKER DIES After Muslim Doctors REFUSE To Help Him,"Such a compassionate faith Bring an 8-year old girl in for a clitorectomy and watch how quickly they sharpen the knives A Pakistani sewer worker died Thursday after doctors refused to treat him due to the fact he was  unclean. Irfan Masih, 30, went unconscious while cleaning a manhole in the city of Umerkot. He was taken to the hospital where he suffocated to death in front of doctors who refused to treat him because he was covered in sewer sludge. The doctors refused to treat him because they were fasting and said my son was  napaak (unclean),  Irshad Masih, the sewer worker s mother, told Pakistan s Express Tribune.Muslims across the world are currently observing the holy month of Ramadan, which requires them to abstain from eating, drinking and sex during daylight hours, but treating the worker does not appear to fall under these rules. Muslim medical professionals across the world frequently work with patients in all sorts of conditions during the holy month. -Daily Caller"
CAUGHT ON TAPE: HORRIFIC ISLAMIC TERROR IN GERMANY…Terrorist Shouts “Allahu Akbar!”…Children Targeted,"Hey America Are you ready for a leader who says, NO  to unvetted refugees? ****WARNING****GRAPHIC VIDEO*** German Chancellor Angela Merkel has recently admitted that terrorists have managed to infiltrate Europe by passing themselves off as refugees. She said that  in part, the refugee flow was even used to smuggle terrorists. This comes as no surprise to those critics of Europe s massive influx of Muslim immigrants. Indeed, upon hearing the news, many are no doubt jumping out of their seats yelling,  we told you so! Just this last May, Neue Osnabr cke Zeitung, a German news source, reported that Germany s Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) has received 369 tip-offs on possible links between refugees and Muslim extremists. German police announced that at least forty asylum seekers were being investigated for alleged terrorism links. It was reported that Germany s spy chief, Hans Georg Maassen, said that Germany s domestic intelligence agency had obtained  strong evidence that  17 people have arrived under Islamic State instructions.  [Emphasis added.] Furthermore, last month, German authorities announced that 499 Islamists were under surveillance, ostensibly because there is credible evidence that they pose a threat. It is not clear if this figure also includes homegrown Islamists.So we now know for certain that some Islamist terrorists have taken advantage of the massive influx of refugees and have successfully infiltrated Europe   and on ISIS  orders. Furthermore, there are undoubtedly even more pending investigations, and it is certain that many Islamist terrorist cells with refugee connections are operating within Europe as of this writing.The largely Muslim migrants have brought no shortage of problems with them: there have been refugee-caused sexual assaults across European cities, increased radicalization of Muslim circles, a lack of assimilation, persecution of Christian migrants, etc. These problems serve to exasperate the assimilation problems that already plague many second-generation Europeans whose parents are from Muslim-majority countries. Given that European birthrates are generally below replacement levels, and that the massive influx of immigrants is, although stemmed in some quarters, still occurring, these problems will unfortunately only become more acute as time goes by. The late Libyan President Mu amar al-Gaddafi once said, alluding to Muslim immigration to Europe, that the Islamization of Europe would happen without the need for the sword. But he surely didn t expect it would happen as fast as we are witnessing now.Since the vast majority of the refugees are Muslims whose culture clashes with native European ones on several well-known fronts, this influx has naturally resulted in growing anti-Islamic sentiment in Europe. It is reported that nationalist and rightist groups are gaining ascendency With the increase in the number of Islamic terrorist acts happening all around the world, including in the heart of the European Union, Europeans certainly have a right to be worried any encroaching Islamism.Via: Counter Jihad"
ESTABLISHMENT GOP END TIMES? Why Republican Candidates Are Kicking RNC To Curb,"In the real world, if your boss is damaging your ability to achieve your full potential, you start looking for a new place of employment. Why should these candidate settle for an organization who isn t representing their best interests? The 2016 GOP presidential campaigns agreed on Sunday evening to cut the Republican National Committee (RNC) out of the debate negotiation process and instead deal directly with networks moderating debates, Breitbart News has learned.Corey Lewandowski, the campaign manager for frontrunner Donald Trump, confirmed to Breitbart News via phone on Sunday that the  biggest consensus  of five separate points the GOP campaigns agreed on was cutting the RNC out of the negotiations with the networks, as the campaigns would each like to negotiate with the networks directly.In response to the revelation that the RNC will be cut out of the process, RNC chief spokesman Sean Spicer the party s point man on handling debates until now said the RNC stands ready to help the candidates in any way they can. The RNC is fully committed to serving the interests of our campaigns,  Spicer told Breitbart News.  We support the best format to present their vision to lead America forward. A campaign manager with another campaign who wished not to be identified confirmed to Breitbart News that the RNC will no longer be handling debate format and that the  campaigns will take the lead  on that. The RNC will still handle basic logistics, though, that campaign manager said.The second point of agreement was that they want information from the networks on things such as qualification criteria earlier than before, Lewandowski said, and third was they want  greater parity and greater integrity  in questions. A fourth point of agreement, according to Lewandowski, was they want debates to last no longer than two hours including commercials and a fifth is they want each candidate to get at least 30 seconds apiece for opening and for closing statements. Mr. Trump has won the last three debates, and he is willing to continue to debate his opponents,  Lewandowski told Breitbart News.  However, the moderators of the debates should not be the story. Instead, the candidates  responses to questions is what the American public should hear. The meeting happened at the Hilton in Alexandria, Virginia, in Old Town on King Street just outside Washington, D.C.Most of the details of what various campaigns wanted was already made public heading into the meeting.  Ben Carson s campaign manager, Barry Bennett, was hopeful that the group could agree on one two-hour debate with every candidate onstage,  the Washington Post s Bob Costa and Dave Weigel reported.They also quoted former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee s campaign manager Sarah Huckabee Sanders, laying out a previously public demand from campaigns. One of the big goals is allowing for more substance and equal time,  Sanders said.  It does make that difficult if there are multiple candidates but the debate s capped at two hours. But the revelation that the RNC will no longer be a part of the debate process has not yet been reported until now.During the meeting, too, according to Costa and Weigel, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush s campaign manager Danny Diaz pushed unsuccessfully for Telemundo to get reinstated as a moderator something Trump would boycott. Bush campaign manager Danny Diaz recommended that Telemundo be reinstated after being dropped along with NBC,  Costa and Weigel wrote.  But the campaign of businessman Donald Trump, represented by manager Corey Lewandowski, threatened to boycott a debate if the Spanish-language network that Trump has clashed with was granted one. Telemundo was supposed to partner with NBC News, but after CNBC s horrendous moderating job in Boulder, Colorado, last week lost its upcoming debate along with partner network NBC News.This revelation also means a last-ditch effort by the RNC to keep control of the process has failed.Via: Matthew Boyle, Breitbart News"
" Trump’s List Of ‘Unreported’ Terror Attacks Is Out, And It’s ABSURD (CITATIONS)","Earlier today, Trump said to a crowd at MacDill Air Force Base that the  very dishonest media  wasn t reporting on the terror attacks that are happening all across Europe all the time. Later on, the media pressed Sean Spicer on that topic while aboard Air Force One, and Spicer s response was to say that they d provide a list  later on.  Well, that list is out, and surprise surprise, it s completely ridiculous.Since Trump s comments focused on Europe and, by extension, the U.S., the following lists are focused there, despite many, many other attacks happening around the world.Perhaps one of the most ridiculous things about the White House s list of attacks is that it includes high-profile attacks that were covered for days on end, such as the 2015 attack against Charlie Hebdo in Paris, and the fateful attack at a Paris club in November. It also includes two foiled attacks that were also widely reported. Broken down:They also list several attacks in France in 2016 that were covered extensively.Then they list an attack in London in December 2015 that was covered by CNN, Reuters, The Huffington Post, USA Today, and more.There s one in Copenhagen, Denmark in February of 2015 that was covered by CNN, The New York Times, USA Today, The Huffington Post, Reuters, and more.Most of us probably remember the March 2016 attack in Brussels, Belgium, which was covered by CNN, NPR, The New York Times, CBS News, NBC News, USA Today, ABC News, and more.But that s Europe. What about the attacks they list here in the U.S. that supposedly weren t covered, or weren t covered extensively enough? Like the following:Really? So far we ve looked closely at 18 of the attacks listed, and they were all widely covered by U.S. media. Trump and his minions insist that we re not covering attacks in Europe hardly at all, and then they provide a list with 30 attacks that are in the Middle East, parts of Asia, and in Indonesia and the Philippines.Those attacks are terrible and tragic, too, but again, Trump didn t say anything about us not covering attacks in those regions. He probably didn t even think about those regions until whoever it was that compiled that list gave it to him (if they gave it to him).But the biggest falsehood is that the media isn t reporting, or is underreporting, on these attacks. It s like they hurriedly compiled a list of terror attacks worldwide from Wikipedia and couldn t be bothered to proofread, let alone research. There are spelling errors in addition to the lie that the media covers up attacks. Our dishonest  president,  has a lot of nerve accusing the media of actively covering up terrorist attacks.The full list, as provided to CNN, is below. Feel free to Google whatever you want:Here s the list the White House sent of attacks they feel  did not receive adequate attention from Western media sources.  pic.twitter.com/lj8eOZQfnY  Kevin Liptak (@Kevinliptakcnn) February 7, 2017Read more:Featured image by Alex Wong via Getty Images"
 Hatred For The Republican Party Reaches 25 Year High,"It s now no surprise that Donald Trump, the most hated presidential candidate in the field, is the GOP s frontrunner. It seems being hated is all the Republican Party is good for these days.And there s even better news for Democrats!A new poll from the Pew Research Center shows that the GOP is overwhelmingly hated by the American public and has reached its highest level of disdain since 1992. According to the poll, 62 percent of Americans have an unfavorable impression of the GOP whereas only 33 percent view it favorably. American s positive perception of the GOP fell four points in the last six months.The poll also found a very interesting trend: most of the negativity towards the GOP came from self-identified Republicans, where only 68 had a favorable view of their own party   an 11 point drop from October.As Trump rises is in the polls, Republicans feelings about their party falls. What a coincidence.In contrast, 45 percent of Americans had a favorable view of the Democratic Party versus 50 percent who harbored negative views. Eighty-eight percent of Democrats had a favorable view of the party.Not surprisingly, Independent voters were more favorable to the Democratic Party   preferring them 37 to 28 percent   than the Republican Party. As Trump continuously tells the public he s winning with Independents, he certainly hasn t been very successful. Also not surprising was respondents who were black, female or young were also much more likely to give favorable impressions of the Democratic Party compared to the GOP.When broken down, the poll reminds us of what we already know:White people, in general, are almost identical in how they feel about both parties; 37 percent have a favorable view of both parties, while 59 percent have an unfavorable view of the Democrats and 58 percent for the Republicans.It looks like the two-party system has failed the oppressed whites yet again   how sad.Over 2,000 Americans responded to the poll, which was conducted between April 12 to 19 and it has a margin of error at 2.5 percent.Featured image via John Sommers II/Getty Images"
 Michele Bachmann Comes Out Of Hiding To Mourn Scalia On Twitter — Gets His Name Wrong (TWEETS),"Michele Bachmann is easily one of the craziest people to ever grace the halls of Congress. She spent her entire tenure being a complete embarrassment and disgrace to the institution which she served, spending more time ranting about abortion, religion, and gay people than actually, you know, trying to govern. All sane people were giddy with glee when she decided not to run for re-election. Shortly thereafter, she faded into the bowels of the more humiliating and shameful parts of America s history, right where she belongs.Well, with the death of extreme right-wing Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, former Congresswoman Bachmann has emerged from her vampire crypt to tell the world just how much she admired the man. She sent out a tweet just hours after his death that read: God Bless Anthony Scalia, finest Sup Ct Justice RIP God bless Anthony Scalia, finest Sup Ct Justice RIP  Michele Bachmann (@MicheleBachmann) February 13, 2016There s just one problem with that: his name is Antonin Scalia, not Anthony. This nitwit can t even get that much right, yet, after that major f*ck up, Bachmann went on to go on a tirade about who should replace the deceased Justice, and, of course, only other extreme right-wingers are even a little bit acceptable to her. Here is that series of insane tweets:Obama must appoint a constitutional originalist to replace Justice Scalia, nothing else will do.  Michele Bachmann (@MicheleBachmann) February 13, 2016She even had the gall to compare Scalia s insane ramblings to William Shakespeare s masterpieces.Reading a Scalia dissent was akin to reading a Shakespearean sonnet. RIP  Michele Bachmann (@MicheleBachmann) February 13, 2016Now Scalia belongs to the ages. Let's add his profile to historical lawgivers which surround the US House chamber.  Michele Bachmann (@MicheleBachmann) February 13, 2016Scalia will be read and quoted 200 years hence, if America survives. RIP  Michele Bachmann (@MicheleBachmann) February 13, 2016He ll be quoted alright, just not in the way that you think. Thank goodness you re no longer in the business of making our laws.Featured image from AI Archives"
BREAKING: SUPREME COURT BLOCKS TEXAS ABORTION RESTRICTIONS,"Wow! The liberal Supreme Court s really making their views known with the past few decisions. Thank goodness for the ACLJ and all the good work they do: This afternoon, the Supreme Court of the United States ordered to stay the Fifth Circuit s ruling upholding the common-sense abortion restrictions passed by Texas in 2013. In a 5-4 vote with Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Scalia, Justice Thomas, and Justice Alito dissenting, the Court granted the application to stay the 5th Circuit decision.As The New York Times reports:The Supreme Court on Monday allowed nine Texas abortion clinics to remain open while the justices consider whether to hear an appeal from a decision effectively ordering them to close. [ ]The case concerns two parts of a state law that imposes strict requirements on abortion providers. One requires all abortion clinics in the state to meet the standards for  ambulatory surgical centers,  including regulations concerning buildings, equipment and staffing. The other requires doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital.Other parts of the law took effect in 2013, causing about half of the state s 41 abortion clinics to close. If the contested provisions take effect, abortion rights advocates said, the number of clinics will again be halved. The Associated Press has more details:The Supreme Court order will remain in effect at least until the court decides whether to hear the clinics  appeal of the lower court ruling, not before the fall.The court s decision to block the regulations is a strong indication that the justices will hear the full appeal, which could be the biggest abortion case at the Supreme Court in nearly 25 years. The ACLJ is mobilizing all of our resources to continue to support Texas as it stands up for the health of women and the lives of unborn babies.At the Fifth Circuit, we filed an amicus brief detailing the dangers of unregulated abortion and the abortion industry s deceptions.We are preparing to file briefs at the Supreme Court to vigorously defend this pro-life law and aggressively protect the lives of thousands of unborn babies and women in need.Our pro-life advocacy is vital in defending the constitutional rights of pro-life crisis pregnancy centers, protecting the health of women and children, and urging Congress to be a voice for the voiceless.Via: ACLJ "
ONE IMAGE PERFECTLY Captures Who’s Really Behind The Trump-Russian Collusion “Investigation”,"Unfounded claims that President Trump was filmed with prostitutes in a Moscow hotel surfaced in the closing stretch of last year s White House race.Mrs. Clinton s presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) reportedly helped fund the research.According to US media reports, Perkins Coie, a law firm representing the Clinton campaign and DNC, hired intelligence firm Fusion GPS in April 2016.  BBCYesterday, another bombshell was revealed by Rep. Jim Jordan on the Lou Dobbs show, when Jordan told Dobbs that he believes the FBI paid Christopher Steele, the creator of the Trump dossier and that they used it to obtain a FISA warrant to spy on Americans associated with the Trump campaign. Jordon told Dobbs:  There are a couple of fundamental questions here. Did the FBI pay Christopher Steele? I asked that of the Attorney General two weeks ago he wouldn t answer the question. Did they actually vet this dossier?  Because it s been disproven, a bunch of lies, a bunch of National Enquirer garbage and fake news in this thing. Did they actually check it out before they brought it to the FISA Court which I m convinced they did. And all of this can be cleared up if they release the application that they took to the court  I think they won t give it to us because they did pay Christopher Steele. I think they did use the dossier as the basis for the warrants to spy on Americans associated with President Trump s campaign. Strzok is the guy who took the dossier to the FISA Court. Watch:Politically Corrupt FBI   @Jim_Jordan: I believe the FBI paid Christopher Steele, and then used the discredited, fake news dossier to spy on @POTUS and his campaign. #MAGA #TrumpTrain #DTS @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/bfgk37LbFC  Lou Dobbs (@LouDobbs) December 8, 2017While Democrats desperately try to convince the American public that Trump colluded with the Russians to defeat one of the most unpopular candidates they ve ever stuck their party with, real journalists continue to uncover the real collusion, and it s looking more and more like sadly, it s between the FBI, Obama s DOJ and investigators working for Special Counsel Robert Mueller.This one image by cartoonist Antonio Branco, pretty much sums up who s really in charge of the phony Trump-Russian collusion sham of an investigation:"
 WATCH: Fox News Host Dana Perino Is DONE Defending Republicans,"Fox News host Dana Perino is finally so sick and tired of Republicans supporting Donald Trump despite all of the sexual assault allegations that she will no longer defend them.During Friday s edition of The Five, host and former George W. Bush press secretary Dana Perino slammed Donald Trump for  talking about all of his accusers  and insulting them instead of focusing on attacking Hillary Clinton.Perino is also furious that Republicans are still defending Trump s predatory behavior. The Republicans that are defending this are really irritating me,  she said.  I ve been like Mount Vesuvius all day. Perino then specifically named Ben Carson and Jeff Sessions as just two of the many Republicans who remain on board the Trump train despite the Republican nominee s comments about groping women and the various allegations made against him by multiple women and the many past statements he has made that are now coming back to haunt him.And after Juan Williams joked that someone is going to call for cutting her mic, Perino took a serious tone, looked straight into the camera and while slicing the air with her hand told Republicans that she is  done  defending them. Yeah, because women should be seen and not heard, apparently. After 20 years of defending these guys, done. Here s the video via YouTube.Perino is not the only Republican woman who has stopped defending Republicans due to their refusal to unendorse Trump.Wisconsin GOP activist Marybeth Glenn quit the party entirely in a series of posts on Twitter blasting Republicans for being cowards and legitimizing charges that conservatives are sexists after she defended them for years. He (Trump) treats women like dogs, and you go against everything I   and other female conservatives   said you were & back down like cowards,  she wrote.  I m sooo done. If you can t stand up for women & unendorse this piece of human garbage, you deserve every charge of sexism thrown at you. Now Perino just became the first Republican woman on Fox News to say she is done defending the GOP.In their refusal to withdraw their support from Trump, the Republican Party is destroying themselves by offending women across the country and now it is costing them allies in states and in the media. This is something that may take generations for the party to recover from. Of course, that s assuming they actually learn anything from the mess they made this year.Featured image via screenshot"
"PELOSI’S HACKED EMAIL SHOWS TOP-SECRET Memo To Staffers: Make #BLM Activists Think Dems Are On Their Side, But Don’t Let Them Come In Large Groups…”DO NOT Say ‘ALL Lives Matter!”","Docs leaked by Guccifer 2.0 show a memo from Nancy Pelosi giving directions to her minions about how to  handle  Black Lives Matter terror group.In the memo, Pelosi is careful to tell the DCCC staff to talk to BLM members, but make sure you don t allow them to meet with you in large numbers. In other words, feed the animals, but keep them at an arms length. This is exactly the kind of rhetoric you would expect from 5-star Nancy (who s net worth is listed at $74.11 million). Keep them engaged so you don t lose the Black voting block, but don t let them get too close Most notable is advising Democrats not to say  All lives matter  or to talk about  black-on-black crime  as this is the  worst thing  to say to Black Lives Matter activists.It describes BLM as  radical , which is pretty accurate and notes that it extends beyond questions of police brutality to  criminal justice reform . What they leave out is they don t want reform, they want eliminate prisons and police.Notice also it advises:  Don t offer support for concrete policy positions . In other words, listen and pretend you care, while offering nothing.Via: Weasel Zippers"
(VIDEO) UN CLIMATE CHANGE FREAKS: “We should make every effort to decrease the world population”,"What an evil bunch of freaks! The agenda is so important to them that they can t see the forest for the trees. Overpopulation is a problem in itself but connecting it to the scam that is global warming is just crazy. These people have such a twisted view of everything that it s really scary. I m 100% FED Up! with the UN climate freaks and their agenda.Climate One founder Greg Dalton and the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) Christiana Figueres, held a discussion in 2013 on the role of women in fighting Global Warming.During the interview Secretary Figueres stated, We should  make every effort,  to reduce the world s population in an effort to fight Climate Change:DALTON: A related issue is fertility rates in population. A lot of people in energy and environmental circles don t wanna go near that because it s politically charged. It s not their issue. But isn t it true that stopping the rise of the population would be one of the biggest levers and driving the rise of green house gases?FIGUERES: I mean we all know that we expect nine billion, right, by 2050. So, yes, obviously less people would exert less pressure on the natural resources.DALTON: So is nine billion a forgone conclusion? That s like baked in, done, no way to change that?HERE S THE VIDEO-IF YOU WANT TO SKIP THE BS THEN JUST GO TO THE 4:20 MARK: A LITTLE MORE ON CHRISTIANA FIGUERES-THE 70 S CALLED AND THEY WANT THEIR RADICAL HIPPIE BACK! AT THE 2:40 MARK SHE SAYS WE NEED A  TRANSFORMATION  (SOUND FAMILIAR) AND A  REVOLUTION  TO CHANGE OUR WAY OF LIFE: FIGUERES: Well there again, there is pressure in the system to go toward that; we can definitely change those, right? We can definitely change those numbers and really should make every effort to change those numbers because we are already, today, already exceeding the planet s planetary carrying capacity, today. To say nothing of adding more population that is really going to overextend our capacity. So yes we should do everything possible. But we cannot fall into the very simplistic opinion of saying just by curtailing population then we ve solved the problem. It is not either/or, it is an and/also.Via: Progressives Today"

VANISHED: ‘Hero Security Guard’ and Star Witness of Las Vegas Shooting is Missing,"TWO PROTAGONISTS: Jesus Campos, and alleged shooter Stephen Paddock.Last week, 21WIRE reported how the Las Vegas police and FBI had suddenly changed their story of the timeline of events associated with Mandalay Bay security guard  hero  and police star witness, Jesus Campos and the alleged shooter Stephen Paddock. *Note*   The Las Vegas mass shooting, currently modern America s deadliest, has already been cycled out of most trending media reports in less than two weeks, as most mainstream outlets have now focused the public s attention on a ready-to-go show trial involving disgraced Hollywood movie mogul Harvey Weinstein. In addition, reportage by former Project Veritas operative Laura Loomer, suggests that the Campos family may have had a gag order placed on them not to talk about the mass-shooting case.Now we can report that Jesus Campos is missing.This has all the hallmarks of a cover-up. Not surprisingly, the mainstream media appear to be disinterested in this story now.FOX News confirmed this morning:The Mandalay Bay security guard who disappeared last week moments before he was scheduled to break his silence in television interviews has not been seen since he went to a walk-in health clinic, his union president said.David Hickey of the Security, Police, and Fire Professionals of America (SPFPA) told reporters Friday that he got a text the night before saying Jesus Campos was taken to a UMC Quick Care facility, though he did not specify where or whom the text came from.A spokesperson at the UMC Quick Care, which has eight locations throughout the Las Vegas area, told Fox News on Monday that they had  heard nothing  about Campos visiting them.Multiple requests from Fox News for SPFPA to comment on the matter were not returned Monday.Hickey said he was meeting with MGM officials Thursday afternoon in the hours before Campos  scheduled television appearances, including one with Fox News.LAS VEGAS SECURITY GUARD JESUS CAMPOS DISAPPEARS MOMENTS BEFORE TV INTERVIEWS For the past four days he s been preparing   we had a meeting with MGM officials, and after that meeting was over, we talked about the interviews, we went to a private area, and when we came out, Mr. Campos was gone,  Hickey told reporters, according to Fox 5 Las Vegas.Hickey said Campos had requested to go public and wanted to tell his story and move on from the Oct. 1 shooting investigation. Police say he was shot just before the crazed gunman killed 58 at music festival on the Las Vegas Strip   though the sequence of events is still in dispute.Campos was last photographed in public on Oct. 10, accepting an  SPFPA Hero Award  for bravery in the line of duty, while dining with Hickey and others at a high-end Vegas steakhouse. But soon afterward, investigators said that the security guard was shot before the massacre, raising questions about whether the hotel did enough to prevent the bloodshed.Hickey has said that before he vanished, Campus was looking forward to telling his side of the story. Right now I m just concerned where my member is, and what his condition is. It s highly unusual,  Hickey said Friday.  I m hoping everything is OK with him and I m sure MGM or the union will let (media) know when we hear something,  he said.(Fox News  Greg Norman contributed to this report)SEE ALSO: The Las Vegas Mass Shooting   More to the Story Than We ve Been ToldREAD MORE DAILY SHOOTER NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Daily Shooter FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE  SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @ 21WIRE.TV"
THE LIST of 34 House Republicans DEMANDING Permanent AMNESTY For Obama’s DACA “Kids”,"Who wants to deport  Dreamers ? Not many people, it turns out. Even veteran immigration restrictionists seem willing to legalize this subset of immigrants in the country illegally if it is part of a package deal. That s true even though a lot of what s said about the DACA recipients is PR-style hooey.For example, it s often said   indeed, former President Barack Obama just recently said   that the approximately 800,000 of them were  brought to this country by their parents.  Well, many were. But that s not required to qualify as a protected Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program recipient under the various plans, including Obama s. You just have to have entered the country illegally before age 16. You could have decided to sneak in against your parents  wishes. You re still a  Dreamer! Likewise, we re told DACA recipients are college-bound high school grads or military personnel. That s an exaggeration. All that s actually required is that the person enroll in a high school course or an  alternative,  including online courses and English-as-a-second-language classes. Under Obama s now-suspended program, you didn t even have to stay enrolled.Compared with the general population, DACA recipients are not especially highly skilled. A recent survey for several pro- Dreamer  groups, with participants recruited by those groups, found that while most DACA recipients are not in school, the vast majority work. But their median hourly wage is only $15.34, meaning that many are competing with hard-pressed lower-skilled Americans.The DACA recipients you read about have typically been carefully selected for their appeal. They re valedictorians. They re first responders. They re curing diseases. They root for the Yankees. They want to serve in the Army. If DACA recipients are the poster children for the much larger population of immigrants in the country illegally, these are the poster children for the poster children.  Chicago Tribune34 Republicans in Congress are not about to let the pesky facts about Obama s  Dreamers  get in the way of lobbying Speaker Ryan to grant them permanent citizenship.Numbers USA reports  Thirty-four Republicans in the House of Representatives signed a letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan calling for passage of a permanent DACA amnesty before the end of the year. Reps. Scott Taylor (R-Va.) and Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.) led the effort.While the lawmakers stop short of demanding passage of a DACA amnesty before the end of the year or including an amnesty in this month s must-pass spending bill, they don t insist on any other immigration-related provisions that would stop future flows of illegal immigration by calling for mandatory E-Verify or to reduce the numerical impact of the amnesty by calling for an end to Chain Migration.The letter reads:Dear Speaker Ryan,We write in support of passing of a permanent legislative solution for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients before the end of the year. DACA recipients   young people brought to America through no fault of their own   are contributing members of our communities and our economy. For many, this is the only country they have ever known. They are American in every way except their immigration status.Since DACA s inception, the federal government has approved approximately 795,000 initial DACA applications and 924,000 renewals. Since being approved for DACA status, an overwhelming majority of these individuals have enrolled in school, found employment, or have served in the military. Studies have shown that passing legislation to permanently protect these individuals would add hundreds of billions to our country s gross domestic product (GDP). That is why the business community, universities, and civic leaders alike support a permanent legislative solution.We agree with President Trump that executive action was not the appropriate process for solving this issue, as was done under the previous administration, and we believe Congress should act. We are compelled to act immediately because many DACA recipients are about to lose or have already lost their permits in the wake of the program s rescission. Not acting is creating understandable uncertainty and anxiety amongst immigrant communities.While we firmly believe Congress must work to address other issues within our broken immigration system, it is imperative that Republicans and Democrats come together to solve this problem now and not wait until next year. We all agree that our border must be enforced, our national security defended, and our broken immigration system reformed, but in this moment, we must address the urgent matter before us in a balanced approach that does not harm valuable sectors of our economy nor the lives of these hard-working young people. We must pass legislation that protects DACA recipients from deportation and gives them the opportunity to apply for a more secured status in our country as soon as possible. Reaching across the aisle to protect DACA recipients before the holidays is the right thing to do.Here s the list of 34 Republicans who need to be drained from the swamp:Rep. Scott Taylor (VA-2) Rep. Dan Newhouse (WA-4) Rep. Mia Love (UT-4) Rep. Mark Amodei (NV-2) Rep. David Valadao (CA-21) Rep. Dave Reichert (WA-8) Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-8) Rep. Mike Coffman (CO-6) Rep.

WHOA! IS GEORGE SOROS Secretly Funding Jill Stein’s [Hillary’s] Recount Effort To Steal The Presidency From Trump?,"A post on Reddit citing an investigative journalist reads as follows:  RED ALERT! JIM STONE DISCOVERS SOROS BOT FUNDING JILL STEIN S RECOUNT CAMPAIGN AT RATE OF $160,000/HOUR!!!! DO NOT FALL ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL, BIG TIME F*CKERY IS AFOOT!!! According to the post a donations to Jill Stein s election recount campaign are being made at a steady rate of $160,000 on the hour every hour of the day.The constant rate of donation, 24 hours a day, suggest that a computer program is being used to post the donations as opposed to real people making grassroots donation.However, the donations are being reported as grassroots donations from a myriad of online supporters to help her verify the integrity of the election.However, if real individuals are in fact making the actual donations they rate of the donations should drop over night when internet traffic is low.The rate should then steadily pick up during the course of the day up and then culminate during the  internet rush hour  when usage peaks, which is usually between 7 and 11 PM.For example the BBC,  the UK s equivalent of CNN, reports hourly average internet usage usage is as follows:If Jill Stein s recount campaign was real and donations are in fact coming in from real grass roots supporters then donations to the campaign should reflect this curve in some manner.However, they do not follow the curve of typical internet..Instead they are coming in at a constant hourly rate of $160,000 per hour every hour on the hour.To illustrate, HNN has compile this graph of Stein s donations per hour superimposed on the BBC s graph of internet usage per hour by device.The graph illustrates Jill Stein s recount donations in orange with a red outline which plots recount donations coming in at a constant rate of 4.16% per hour.It is impossible for Jill Stein s recount campaign to be receiving the same amount of donations from real online users every hour on the hour when real internet usage among devices varies widely hour to hour, specifically it peaks in the evening and becomes virtually non-existent between 1 am and 6 am in the morning.This clearly indicates the donations to the recount campaign are not from  grassroots internet users  but instead are the result of a computer programmed bot which is working behind the scenes to fund the campaign.It is almost as perplexing that Jill Stein s managed to raise in less than 24 hours more money than she has raised throughout her entire campaign but that is another story. Namely, Hillary Clinton is having Jill dirty her hands to demand a recount so Hillary is not implicated in not accepting the results of the election.It is still uncertain there is even a prima facie case for Stein to even demand a recount given she failed to capture more than 2% of the vote in any state. If Republicans stand their ground on this argument, Hillary will have to step out from behind her proxy and get her own hands hands dirty to force a recount to happen.Via Reddit:"
 Seth Meyers Dubs Oregon Militia Terrorist #Tarpman In Most Hilarious Mockery Yet (VIDEO),"The domestic terrorists who are holed up in the federal building of an Oregon wildlife refuge get more ridiculous by the day. Perhaps the most bizarre scene from this insanity yet has been a guy who is sitting in the middle of a vacant lot underneath a blue tarp with nothing but his penis extension rifle for comfort. Of course, despite the absolutely serious nature of this armed occupation, the ridiculousness of it all definitely gives plenty of material to late night comics, and comedian Seth Meyers has taken full advantage of that.On Wednesday night s edition of his show, Meyers dubbed this particular militia idiot  Tarpman,  and proceed to mock him relentlessly. Luckily, MSNBC s Lawrence O Donnell was kind enough to share the hilarity with us.First, the clip showed the local sheriff trying to be sensible and get these yahoos to leave. Then, it panned to  Tarpman  hiding with his gun. After that, we see Seth Meyers relentlessly mocking this insanity. He even called  Tarpman  a  guess in a game of militia Clue. Watch the clip below, via MSNBC:Well, it seems that this particular terrorist, Levoy Finicum, has gotten his fifteen minutes of fame, and they re not about to be over.Congratulations, Mr. Finicum.

NANCY PELOSI’S Latest Over-The-Top Claim: Trump will “take food out of the mouths of babies and seniors”,"Nancy Pelosi s latest claim is over the top:In a conference call with reporters, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, criticized Trump s late push for some funding for the wall now, which she said would be wrong if it was budgeted for at the expense of government programs like those that help young people, the elderly and the environment. He did not promise that he would take food out of the mouths of babies and seniors and education, clean air, clean water, scientific research off the table in a significant way in order for him to pay for his immoral, ineffective, unwise proposal of a wall,  Pelosi said.But she said she was open to some technology and other improvements at the border so long as they were not related in any way to the planning, prepping or building of the wall itself. Read more: The HillHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi was on Meet the Press and let out another gibberish laden response to a question. Does anyone out there understand what she meant by her comments about the wall. How does it mean Trump is weak if he wants a wall? Twisted reasoning is all that comes from Pelosi these days especially when in 2006 most prominent Democrats voted to build a barrier at the border. Immoral and unwise ? How is it immoral and unwise to want to protect your people? You have to understand this part of the country. There s a community going through it. WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED TO THE 2006 BORDER WALL FENCE?Remember the promise of a fence on our southern border? Yes, it was the plan but the $1.2 billion dollar plan was never executed as proposed. You can thank our Liar in Chief and a popular Republican for that WE RECENTLY POSTED THIS VIDEO OF AN IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL SAYING BUILDING A BORDER FENCE  ISN T POSSIBLE  EVEN THOUGH $1.2 BILLION WAS GIVEN IN 2006 FOR A FENCE:  In his speech in El Paso on immigration reform on May 10, 2011, Obama declared that the fence along the border with Mexico is  now basically complete.  Like much of what comes out of the Obama administration, that was a lie. What was supposed to be built was a double layered fence with barbed-wire on top, and room for a security vehicle to patrol between the layers. Except for 36 of the seven-hundred mile fence, what was built looks like the picture above or the one below.But that doesn t stop your liar in chief. He claims. We have gone above and beyond what was requested by the very Republicans who said they supported broader reform as long as we got serious about enforcement,  Obama said.  All the stuff they asked for, we ve done. But even though we ve answered these concerns, I ve got to say I suspect there are still going to be some who are trying to move the goal posts on us one more time. Maybe he s right the goal posts were moved, but to make the job easier.The Secure Fence Act was introduced on Sept. 13, 2006 by Rep Peter King (R-NY) and passed Congress on a bi-partisan basis. In the House of Representatives, the Fence Act passed 283 -138 on September 14, 2006. On September 29, 2006, the Fence Act passed in the Senate 80 -19. The Secure Fence Act of 2006 s goal was to help secure America s borders to decrease illegal entry, drug trafficking, and security threats by building 700 miles (1,100 km) of physical barriers along the Mexico-United States border. Additionally, the law authorized more vehicle barriers, checkpoints, and lighting as well as authorizing the Department of Homeland Security to increase the use of advanced technology such as cameras, satellites, and unmanned aerial vehicles to reinforce infrastructure at the border. So far less than 40 miles of a real fence have been built   most of it during the Bush Administration.Of the almost 700 miles of fencing, DHS reports there are currently 36.3 miles of double-layered fencing, as the bill required, the kind with enough gap that you can drive a vehicle between the layers. But the majority of the fencing erected has been made from vehicle barriers with single-layer pedestrian fencing, the kind of barriers that are designed to stop vehicles rather than people. The design specifications vary, depending on geography and climate characteristics, but according to the Customs and Border Patrol website, those include  post on rail  steel set in concrete; steel picket-style fence set in concrete; vehicle bollards similar to those found around federal buildings;  Normandy; vehicle fence consisting of steel beams; and concrete jersey walls with steel mesh. The first blow against the promised fence was made by Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican Senator from Texas, at the urging of DHS she proposed an amendment to give the Department discretion to decide what type of fence was appropriate in different areas. The law was amended to read,  Nothing in this paragraph shall require the Secretary of Homeland Security to install fencing, physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors in a particular location along an international border of the United States, if the Secretary determines that the use or placement of such resources is not the most appropriate means to achieve and maintain operational control over the international border at such location.  Hutchison s amendment was included in a federal budget bill in late 2007 despite the fact that Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., had a cow he argued the amendment effectively killed the border fence promised in the 2006 bill, he was right. Hutchison s intentions may have been honorable, but she didn t foresee Barack Obama being the next president.When Janet Napolitano became Obama s first DHS she took advantage of Ms. Hutchison s 2007 amendment, instead of building a fence which look something like the below, she built a fence that was mostly a combination of the two pictures above.When She was still Governor of Arizona Janet Napolitano said,  You show me a 50-foot wall, and I ll show you a 51-foot ladder at the border. And she may be right The fence will never STOP all illegal crossings. The purpose of the fence is two-fold, slowing the intruders and making them visible to members of the border patrol. The rest of the work is done by human beings.Very little of the Israeli separation barrier erected to keep out terrorists is a wall, most of the 400 miles of the barrier which has received so much international scorn is a two layered fence like section of their barrier below. The fence has served its purpose, in 2002, the year before construction started, 457 Israelis were murdered; in 2009, 8 Israelis were killed.The reason it has been effective is not simply the fence itself but how the fence is guarded and patrolled. And that s what will make our fence along the Mexican border work.Here s the bottom line. Back in 2006 the people of the U.S. were promised a border fence. Since then thanks to Kay Bailey Hutchison and Barack Obama 95% of the fence wasn t built. The arguments against the fence are bogus especially if you look at Israel s history. It s time for America to demand that its leaders build the fence they promised. No one can honestly say it wont work, after all it hasn t been tried. Via: The Lid"
LIBERAL LUNATIC Who Threatened to “Kill” Republican Senator Gets a Dose of Karma,"The FBI finally delivered a dose of karma to a loony liberal from Iowa who threatened to kill Republican Senator Joni Ernst. Is the FBI cracking down on threats to U.S. officials? You have to wonder why the people who have threatened President Trump haven t been given the same treatment. We know that the Secret Service interviewed Kathy Griffin after her  beheading Trump  video came out.

WATCH TV NEWS CREW GO UNDERCOVER: “Homeless” Taking Credit Cards? Panhandlers Living In High Rent Neighborhoods?,"With homeless or needy people on just about every corner, how do we know who truly needs help, or who is just looking to game the system? This undercover expose on the explosion of  homeless  people on just about every corner in suburban Detroit shines a light on the  business  of panhandling. Should panhandling be protected by the First Amendment?Panhandlers standing on the corners has become an increasing issue. Men, women, old and young, all begging for your money.The problem has moved from the city to the suburbs, but why? And, should you give?It seems to have happened in recent months. Panhandlers, everywhere, including American s first highway, Woodward Avenue.They hold signs and pull at your heart strings. Some claim to be homeless, to have cancer, or be a veteran who is hungry. But, are we being conned?We spotted a young guy at the corner of Woodward Avenue and Maple on a recent Friday afternoon panhandling. Moments later, we watched as he folded up his sign and walked to a nearby parking lot where he got into a dark colored SUV.We spotted the same SUV on different occasions at a house in a nice neighborhood in West Bloomfield. When confronted, the young guy first closed the door without answering if he considered what he was doing fraud.Moments later, after being exposed, he came out, profanities flying   upset he was going to be on TV.To some, panhandling has become a job. Honest Abe  and his crew work the corner at 8 Mile and Woodward daily. He even accepts credit cards, but says he is truly homeless and panhandling frauds are becoming more frequent.The problem is growing. Corners that were once off limits are now prime real estate and a recent court ruling involving the Michigan Chapter of the ACLU allows it to happen. Court said conduct of asking for money in public is a form of free speech, it must be protected by the First Amendment.  Attorney Ryan Berman told 7 Action News.We discovered many panhandlers work in teams, sharing signs and corners. Some use your money to buy food, others trade the cash for drugs, booze or cigarettes.Elizabeth Kelly with Hope Shelter in Pontiac says if you want to really help, there are other ways to give. If you really want your donation to do the most good, the very best thing is to give it to an agency that is going to move them forward.  Via: WXYZ "
BOOM! KELLYANNE CONWAY Schools CNN’s Anderson Cooper On The Comey Firing [Video],"Kellyanne Conway went at it with Anderson Cooper and came out on top when she basically schooled Cooper on the chain of command in government. The facts make no sense to him because he s in denial. Conway said Trump s decision to fire James Comey had nothing to do with the FBI s investigation into Russian interference in the presidential election. She goes on to explain to Cooper that the letter recommending that Comey be fired was sent to President Trump. Was Trump supposed to then deny the Assistant Attorney General s decision? It s good to note that the Assistant AG was just confirmed by over 90% of the Senate. He s a bipartisan choice and a well respected man who came into his position under AG Jeff Sessions just two weeks ago. The letter sent to Trump summarized the numerous things that prove the case for the recommendation of firing Comey. TRUMP DID NOT DO THIS ALONE But you have the fake news media beating the RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA drums over and over.Watch how Kellyanne Conway runs circles around Anderson Cooper while Cooper just keeps coming back to the Russia scenario: It s not a cover up. The president makes it very clear in his letter. Comey assured him he s not under investigation. I think you re looking at wrong set of facts here. You re going back to the campaign. This man is president of the United States. He acted decisively today. You want this to be about Russia when this is about restoring public confidence in the FBI The FBI director reports to deputy attorney general, the deputy attorney general reports to the attorney general and the attorney general reports to the president of the United States. This has nothing to do with Russia. It has everything to do with whether the current FBI director has the president s confidence and can faithfully and capably execute his duties. "
CLINTON CAMPAIGN STAFFERS Prematurely Popped Open Champagne Early Tuesday…Here’s How They Got It So Wrong,"Mrs. Clinton s campaign was so confident in her victory that her aides popped open Champagne on the campaign plane early Tuesday. But that conviction, aides would later learn, was based largely on erroneous data showing that young, black and Latino voters and suburban women who had been turned off by Mr. Trump s comments but viewed Mrs. Clinton unfavorably would turn out for her in higher numbers than they ultimately did.Exit polls conducted by Edison Research found that among people who said they had decided in the final week before Election Day, 47 percent voted for Mr. Trump and 42 percent for Mrs. Clinton.Read more: NYT "
HILLARY WORKED FEVERISHLY To Return 10 Russian Spies Operating In U.S. In Midst Of Selling 20% Of U.S. Uranium To Russia,"Why is this not front page news on every major media outlet?Russian intelligence targeted Hillary Clinton before she became secretary of state in 2009, FBI documents show.New FBI information about corruption in a Clinton-approved uranium deal with Russia raises questions about Clinton s actions after the FBI broke up a deep-cover Russian spy ring in 2010.For a decade, the FBI ran an operation called Ghost Stories to monitor and rip apart a deep-cover Russian agent network. Ghost Stories tracked a ring Russian spies who lived between Boston and Washington, D.C., under false identities. It was one of the FBI s most elaborate and successful counterintelligence operations in history.After the FBI arrested 10 of the spies in June, 2010, Secretary of State Clinton worked feverishly to return the Russian agents to Moscow in a hastily arranged, lopsided deal with Putin.It all happened as the uranium deal was in play: An arrangement to provide Moscow s state Rosatom nuclear agency with 20 percent of American uranium capacity, with $145,000,000 to pour into the Clinton Family Foundation and its projects.For the Clintons, the FBI s biggest counterintelligence bust in history couldn t have come at a worse time.The day the FBI arrested the Russian agents, on June 28, 2010, the day before the secretary of state s husband, Bill Clinton, was to give a speech in Moscow. A Kremlin-connected investment bank, Renaissance Capital, paid the former president $500,000 for the hour-long appearance.An unnamed Hillary Clinton spokesman told ABC News that there was  no reason to think the Secretary was a target of this spy ring. That was a lie.Under the code name Operation Ghost Stories, the FBI had been working the ring for a decade. Its targets had burrowed in along the Acela Corridor between Boston, New York, and Washington DC. They lived normal daily lives as Americans to attend universities, run businesses, marry, and conceive and raise children to infiltrate society and subvert government institutions. One of the SVR agents had stolen the identity of a six-week-old Canadian baby who had died in 1963. That prompted the Ghost Stories code name. The ring inspired the FX network s television series,  The Americans. As with any secretary of state, Hillary Clinton would be a primary target under any circumstance. But she was much more. She was a known quantity: predictable, vain and ruthless, and with an insatiable desire for cash to enrich her family, friends, and political machine. Blindly ambitious to become president of the world s only superpower and swearing to come back after losing in 2008 to Barack Obama, she was the 21st century KGB s perfect mark.Read more: Daily Caller"
POPE SHAMES AMERICANS From Mexico For Anti-Immigrant Sentiment…Doesn’t Mention $BILLIONS Taxpayers Give Faith Based Charities To Bring MUSLIM Immigrants To U.S.,"Pope Francis has joined Democrat legislators, along with a handful of RINO s and local mayors to work hand-in-hand with Obama to push immigration from Mexico and South America to the US.  Every player in this scheme has their own agenda. Of course, Obama has only one desire, and that is to fundamentally transform America. Democrat legislators are working to secure a dependent voting base. The RINO s (Republicans In Name Only) are beholden to large corporations, whose only goal is to secure cheap labor. Finally, local mayors want the federal funding that comes with placement of each immigrant in their communities. Besides the obvious charitable aspect, what s in it for Pope Francis? What s in it for the Catholic church? Many Catholics (myself included) are wondering why we pass the collection basket more than once several times throughout the year to help subsidize churches, schools and orphanages in Mexico and South America if the ultimate goal is to bring them here? Make no mistake, Pope Francis is interjecting himself into the 2016 Presidential election by walking with illegal aliens on the Mexican side of the border who want to get into the US.This is a direct assault by the Catholic Church on Donald Trump and any other Republicans (including the Governor of Texas) who say they want to close the US border with Mexico.Yesterday, in Ciudad Juarez, one of the most violent cities in the Western Hemisphere thanks to the drug cartels, the pope walked up a ramp covered in flowers toward a cross  erected  in memory of migrants who have perished trying to reach the United States just a stone s throw away,  according to Reuters.The pope then blessed three more small crosses, at which  shoes of migrants who died  were laid.  We cannot deny the humanitarian crisis,  Pope Francis intoned.  Each step, a journey laden with grave injustices: the enslaved, the imprisoned and extorted; so many of these brothers and sisters of ours are the consequence of trafficking in human beings Injustice is radicalized in the young; they are  cannon fodder,  persecuted and threatened when they try to flee the spiral of violence and the hell of drugs. Then there are the many women unjustly robbed of their lives. He concluded,  Let us together ask our God for the gift of conversion, the gift of tears, let us ask him to give us open hearts like the Ninevites, open to his call heard in the suffering faces of countless men and women. No more death! No more exploitation! They are not refugees! People escaping poverty or crime are not legally refugees, but the Pope and the NO Borders Left are purposefully confusing the terminology. They want all migrants-on-the-move to be called REFUGEES who are then entitled to protection and welfare. Why stop at the Mexican border? What about the Iraqi Christian population that s been almost completely wiped out? Why is the Pope standing on the Mexican border demanding we open the flood gates in the name of charity, while tens of thousands of Christians are being slaughtered in the Middle East?Where is the outcry from the Pope as the Catholic Charities/U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (CC/USCCB) are being paid BILLIONS to  bring mostly MUSLIM immigrants, who are being vetted by the corrupt UN to the US from the Middle East, and strategically seeding them across the United States? The following map provided by the Office of Refugee Resettlement identifies where the primary nine VOLAGs operate within America and where their affiliate sites are located:Here is the list of Charities who work with the US Department s Refugee Resettlement Program:  CWS   Church World Service  ECDC   Ethiopian Community Development Council  HIAS   Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society  IRC   International Rescue Committee  LIRS   Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Services  CC/USCCB   Catholic Charities/U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops  USCRI   U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants  EMM   Episcopal Migration Ministries WRI World Relief Inc.Additionally, there are 350 subcontractors in 190 cities affiliated with the nine main refugee VOLAGs and the chart below lists the amount of money awarded by the federal government to these contractors since 2008.As you can see the amount of money that has been awarded to these non-governmental organizations is enormous with the total since 2008 amounting to over $4 billion.Simpson notes that  because they are non-governmental organizations (NGOs), they can and do lobby for advantageous changes to law and build allies in Congress and the bureaucracy, all fertilized by an open spigot of taxpayer dollars. From this point, as an American, you should be absolutely stunned at what is going on behind the scenes without your knowledge nor your input in regards to the fact that your taxpayer money along with your elected officials are undermining your security by allowing these organizations operate without any oversight. The push by fourteen Senate democrats for 65,000 refugees along with the eighty-four mayors is only the beginning though, as seventy-two House democrats have also joined this coalition.In letter on September 11, 2015, initiated by Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI.) and signed by seventy-one democrats, they urge Obama to resettle over three times the 65,000 refugees initially pushed for by the Senate democrats back in May. The House democrats cite Refugee Council USA, just as the fourteen Senators did, and  recommend that the United States resettle a minimum of 200,000 refugees by the end of 2016, including 100,000 Syrian refugees.  Neglecting the fact that the FBI has stated that they have no way of properly vetting the 2,500 Syrian refugees that we ve already accepted, it further goes to show how little these Senators, Representatives, Mayors, and VOLAGs care about the repercussions of admitting 100,000 into our country.In her book, Refugee Resettlement and the Hijra to America, Ann Corcoran explains that  Refugee resettlement has become a major money-maker for what can only be described as the  Religious Left,  whose goal is to change the demographic make-up of the 180-plus cities and towns in which they presently work.  Corcorans  statement perfectly describes exactly what is happening as push for more and more refugees comes solely from the Left. Whether it be Mayors, Senators, or Representatives in the House, they re all seeking to change the demographic make-up of the United States by forcing the taxpayers to subsidize their own destruction.WATCH ANN CORCORAN S POWERFUL VIDEO explaining how the faith-based charities are working with the US State Department to flood our nation with MULSIM refugees HERE:There is plenty of blame to go around when it comes to the willful  destruction of the greatest and most generous nation on earth.

NEW FINDINGS SHOW TWO IMPORTANT Words Were Deleted From Cowardly Comey’s Remarks About Hillary That Could’ve Ended Her Presidential Bid,"The word  crooked  doesn t only apply to Hillary. Sadly, America is finding out that there are very few people in positions of power who we can trust. Perhaps the reason President Trump has so many loyal supporters is that Americans believe he s the only person in Washington with the courage and ability to actually drain the cesspool of corrupt government agencies in Washington DC Early drafts of former FBI Director James Comey s remarks about former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton s use of a private email server acknowledged that there was evidence she had violated a federal statute prohibiting  gross negligence,  but that phrase was deleted, according to Sen. Chuck Grassley.Grassley, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, has been investigating the formulation of Comey s controversial July 2016 remarks in which he announced that the FBI would not seek criminal charges following its probe into Clinton s use of a private email server.The Iowa Republican on Monday said the FBI had recently turned over records relating to then-Director Comey s statement. The FBI included in those documents what Grassley said appears to be a May 2, 2016 draft of Comey s exoneration statement.The draft was written two months before Comey s July 5, 2016 press conference in which he said that he did not believe Clinton had broken any laws even though she had been  extremely careless  in her handling of sensitive, highly classified material.In the draft in question, Grassley said the Comey statement included the following sentence:  There is evidence to support a conclusion that Secretary Clinton, and others, used the private email server in a manner that was grossly negligent with respect to the handling of classified material. The same draft included the following sentence:  Similarly, the sheer volume of information that was properly classified as Secret at the time it was discussed on email (that is, excluding the  up classified  emails) support an inference that the participants were grossly negligent in their handling of that information. Despite this reference to  gross negligence,  Grassley said the same draft statement goes on to determine she should not be prosecuted for a crime.Grassley asked for more details about the documents, including copies of the drafts in their original format and all records relating to discussions about why the edits were made, in a letter sent to FBI Director Christopher Wray Monday. As you are aware, 18 U.S.C. 793(f) makes the mishandling of classified material through gross negligence a criminal act,  Grassley wrote.  Although Director Comey s original version of his statement acknowledged that Secretary Clinton had violated the statute prohibiting gross negligence in the handling of classified information, he nonetheless exonerated her in that early May 2nd draft statement anyway, arguing that this part of the statute should not be enforced. Grassley said later edits,  on or around about June 10  remove those two sentences and include the following sentence instead:  Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information. Comey had the opportunity to charge a woman, who has been accused of breaking the law numerous times, with a crime, and in doing so, would have proved to all of America that nobody, even if their last name is  Clinton , is above the law. Once again, however, Crooked Hillary managed to wriggle off the hook of justice Grassley and Sen. Lindsey Graham, (R., S.C.) said in late August that Comey began drafting a statement rejecting the idea of charging Clinton with a crime over the email issue two months before Clinton was interviewed in the FBI probe. The senators released partial transcripts of interviews the Judiciary Committee conducted with U.S. officials to back up the statement.For entire story: WFB "
Canada’s Immigration Website Crashes After Trump Pulls Ahead," 21st Century Wire says According to reports from Business Insider, the Canadian government s immigration website crashed tonight following reports that Donald Trump was pulling ahead in the US after calling a victory in traditional Democrat stronghold of Wisconsin.Clinton surrogate Miley Cyrus.A number of high profile US liberals had said previously that they would  leave the country  if Trump won the presidency, including actor Bryan Cranston and controversial pop singer Miley Cyrus (photo, left), both of who are staunch Hillary Clinton supporters. The barrage of celebrity Clinton campaigners threatening to leave the US helped to propel this talking point nationwide and seems to fall neatly into line with the Clinton campaign s negative fear-based campaign strategy.According to online searches, the Canadian site went down just after 10:30 pm ET on Tuesday evening followed by a surge in traffic, presumably for information on emigrating north of the border.Other key states have shocked pollsters and media  experts  in this election including strong Trump performances in Michigan, Ohio, Florida, North Carolina and Arizona.Stay up to date with all the results on the Business Insider live-blog here SEE ALSO: How to move to Canada and become a Canadian citizenREAD MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files"
 Trump ‘Really Likes’ The Idea Of A Violent Uprising When He’s Impeached,"According to Trump ally Alex Jones, when Donald Trump is impeached all bets are off. He won t tell his supporters to accept the decision of the American people. He won t urge calm. In fact, he quite enjoys the idea of a violent uprising in his name.Recently, TMZ approached Trump ally Roger Stone in an airport and asked about impeachment. This is not 1974,  Stone said.  People will not stand for [the impeachment of President Trump]. Any politician who votes for it would be endangering their own life. There will be violence on both sides. Stone clarified that a civil war  will happen  if The Donald is impeached. I was told the president really liked Roger Stone s clip on TMZ when they confronted him in an L.A. airport saying,  We re going to impeach Trump.'  Jones said during an interview with recently pardoned criminal Joe Arpaio after the former Maricopa County sheriff  said that  people who want to take me down better watch out. Trump has never exactly shied away from violence. In fact, when people oppose him at his rallies, he quite literally tells his meth-addled fascist followers to attack them. He has even offered to pay legal fees for supporters who brutally beat black men at his events.Unfortunately for Trump s supporters, a violent uprising will not go so well for them. While they view the Left as anti-gun, many of us are well-armed and (unlike them) properly trained to defend ourselves. We just don t worship our weapons like they do.Watch the interview below:Featured image via Gerry Images (Ralph Freso)"

 Amazing 1922 Article On Hitler Perfectly Predicts Rise Of Trump (TWEET),"A 94-year-old article from the New York Times about Adolph Hitler has gone viral, as observers have recognized shocking similarities between how the article reports on the early political years of the infamous dictator and modern reporting on Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump.The piece was unearthed by Wall Street Journal reporter Jon Ostrower, and has been shared thousands of times now by intrigued followers. The original story can also be read on the New York Times website under the headline,  New Popular Leader Rises In Bavaria. Out of curiosity, I found the first NYT reference to Adolf Hitler. Nov. 21, 1922. Amazing last three paragraphs. pic.twitter.com/VhBnlSsfNm  Jon Ostrower (@jonostrower) March 2, 2016The article starts off by noting,  This reactionary Nationalistic anti-Semitic movement has now reached a point where it is considered potentially dangerous, although not for the immediate future.  Trump s foray into presidential politics was of course greeted by derision, as both Democrats and Republicans assumed there wasn t any serious constituency for Trump s buffoonish act. But within the Republican Party, there is a clear appetite for his brand of nonsense mixed in with a heavy dose of racism and xenophobia.Taking note of the Hitler supporters who  beat up protesting Socialists and Communists  the article rings true as we are treated daily to Trump rallies where supporters have been encouraged by the candidate and his campaign goons to rough up disruptive protesters, or in some cases, perfectly quiet protesters who happened to be black.But it is the closing paragraphs of the article that have so many matching up the reporting on Hitler to Trump. It reflects a view of Hitler and Jews that through the lens of history sounds disgustingly optimistic:But several reliable, well-informed sources confirmed he idea that Hitler s anti-Semitism was not so genuine or violent as it sounded, and that he was merely using anti-Semitic propaganda as a bait to catch masses of followers and keep them aroused, enthusiastic an in line for the time when his organization is perfected and sufficiently powerful to be employed effectively for political purposes.A sophisticated politician credited Hitler with peculiar political cleverness for laying emphasis and over-emphasis on anti-Semitism, saying:  You can t expect the masses to understand or appreciate your finer real aims. You must feed the masses with cruder morsels and ideas like anti-Semitism. It would be politically all wrong to tell them the truth about where you are really leading them. We are faced with a political candidate who insists a large swath of Latinos are  rapists,  who urges registration and bans of Muslims, and who has called for the execution of black men that were falsely accused of rape. And he has already inspired acts of violence against minorities, and his most ardent supporters are often within or sympathetic to the white power movement. Trump himself refused to immediately disavow an endorsement from the Ku Klux Klan in a TV interview.It isn t a stretch to see the parallels between this historical reporting and those who insist Trump s rhetoric is just rhetoric.Featured image via Flickr"
TRUMP: “Let Obamacare fail… I’m not going to own it.”,"In an  impromptu  White House presser during President Trump s lunch with Vice President Pence, Trump drove home how  disappointed  he is about health care:  Let Obamacare fail, it will be a lot easier. And I think we re probably in that position where we ll just let Obamacare fail. We re not going to own it. I m not going to own it. I can tell you the Republicans are not going to own it. We ll let Obamacare fail and then the Democrats are going to come to us.  Why it matters: Trump is acknowledging defeat and now, rather than support Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell s push to repeal with out a replacement bill, he s decided to let Barack Obama s Affordable Care Act remain the law of the land. fast forward and McConnell s straight repeal plan collapses with 3  no votes.  The three no votes came from three women who should really be in the D column: By Tuesday afternoon, three Republican senators   all women   had come out against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell s plan to push a vote on a clean Obamacare repeal bill   enough to sink it altogether. Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) confirmed they would not vote for a repeal bill that delayed enacting the policy by two years.Susan Collins needs to go!President Trump also said he was  surprised  when Senators Moran and Lee came out as  No s  last night.  We thought they were in fairly good shape. For 7 years I ve been hearing repeal and replace  and when we finally get a chance to repeal and replace, we can t. We are winning the war on the border, we re decimating ISIS  we ve had a lot of victories but we haven t had a victory on health care. I m very disappointed. Once the Affordable Care Act fails, then everyone needs to  come together and fix it,  said Trump. Democrats have no ideas. They have no thought process. All they want to do is obstruct government and obstruct period. Obamacare isn t failing, it s failed. It s gone. "

NEW STUDY Shows Why Atheists and People Who Agree With Immigrants That Bash Their Country Use LESS BRAIN POWER,"It s not at all surprising that at least 28% of Democrats consider themselves to be atheists. Fascinating This has to be embarrassing . . . if you re an atheist. A new study performed at the University of York used targeted magnetism to shut down part of the brain. The result: belief in God disappeared among more than 30 percent of participants.That in itself may not seem so embarrassing, but consider that the specific part of the brain they frazzled was the posterior medial frontal cortex the part associated with detecting and solving problems, i.e., reasoning and logic.In other words, when you shut down the part of the brain most associated with logic and reasoning, greater levels of atheism result.You ve heard the phrase,  I don t have enough faith to be an atheist ? Apparently, we can now also say,  I have too many brains to be an atheist.   The American VisionDaily Mail  The study was carried out by Dr Keise Izuma from the University of York and Colin Holbrook from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).They recruited 38 participants with an average age of 21, to take part in the study.Each of these participants said they held significant religious beliefs, and the majority held moderate to extremely conservative political beliefs.Political views were important because it suggested they were more likely to have stronger viewpoints on immigration.Half of these participants formed part of a control group and received a low-level  sham  procedure that did not affect their brains.The other half received enough energy through transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to lower activity in the posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC).This part of the brain, located near the surface and roughly a few inches up from the forehead, is associated with detecting problems and triggering responses that address them.Following the treatment, all the participants were first asked to think about death before being asked questions about their religious beliefs and their feelings about immigrants.The death task including writing brief responses on the subject of their own death.To address their levels of prejudice, participants were asked to read two essays   one critical and one positive   written by an immigrant from Latin America about the US.After reading each essay, participants rated how much they liked the person who wrote the essay and how much they agreed with their views.Religious belief was measured using a version of the Supernatural Belief Scale.Items were presented in random order and rated according to the same scale used in the immigrant ratings.Questions included:  There exists an all-powerful, all-knowing, loving God ,  There exist good personal spiritual beings, whom we might call angels  and  There exists an evil personal spiritual being, whom we might call the Devil. Circa   So how do Democrats and Republicans stack up when it comes to having faith vs. athesists?According to the Pew Research Center,  nones    people who don t identify with any religion   make up 23 percent of American adults.In the Democratic Party, that number is even bigger. 28 percent of Democrats are non-religious, Pew s research shows.Conversely, people who identify as non-religious are much more likely to vote Democratic. 70 percent of self-identifying atheists, for example, voted for President Obama in 2012, according to Pew.One of those atheists is James White, a Texas delegate for Hillary Clinton at this year s DNC. At the convention on Monday, White was wearing a shirt that read,  I m actually an atheist. White said he still feels it s necessary to publicly broadcast his beliefs to promote acceptance of atheism within the party. When we make it safe for people to realize that a nearly 60-year-old Texas middle-aged white guy is an atheist and a Democrat, those things make it easier for others to come forward too,  he said. There has been some progress, White said. Earlier this year, the Texas Democratic Party adopted three secular resolutions into its official policy platform.The investigators additionally found that the magnetic stimulation had the greatest effect on reactions to the critical author in the essay test. We think that hearing criticisms of your group s values, perhaps especially from a person you perceive as an outsider, is processed as an ideological sort of threat,  said Dr Izuma. One way to respond to such threats is to  double down  on your group values, increasing your investment in them, and reacting more negatively to the critic,  he continued. When we disrupted the brain region that usually helps detect and respond to threats, we saw a less negative, less ideologically motivated reaction to the critical author and his opinions.

 Obama Shows How He’s Going To Destroy Trump This Fall And It’s Hilarious,"President Obama is widely expected to be an extremely valuable asset for the Democratic Party in this November s general election, and he gave a preview of just how he d rip Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to shreds at a campaign event on Friday night.Speaking to Democrats in Austin, Texas, President Obama talked about Trump s ridiculous Trump steaks show and tell session, noting that there s  a debate inside of the other party that is fantasy, and school yard taunts, and sellin  stuff like it s the home shopping network. Obama also mocked the Republican establishment for claiming they are surprised by the hate that Trump has whipped up. From the White House pool report:Obama also again mocked establishment Republicans, who he argues say We re shocked someone is fanning anti-immigrant or anti-muslim sentiment!   We re shocked!. We re shocked that someone could be loose with the facts. Or distort someone s record. Shocked! How could you be shocked? This was the guy who was sure I was born in Kenya. And wasn t letting go   As long as it was being directed at me they were fine with it. It was a hoot   and suddenly they re shocked! That gamblings going on in this establishment,  he said.Obama said Donald Trump is  A distillation of what has been going on in their party for more than a decade   this is the message that s been fed   that you just deny the evidence of science. That compromise is a betrayal. That the other side isn t simply wrong, we disagree   the other side is destroying the country. Or treasonous. Look it up, that s what they ve been saying. So they can t be surprised when somebody says,  I can make up stuff better than that.' As other Democrats have made clear, Obama said the right had to own what is happening in Trump s campaign:  The reaction is something they have to take responsibility for and then make an adjustment. It is clear that Obama will be out on the trail, making sure that a campaign of hate does not usher in his successor. Trump has a world of rhetorical hate coming towards him from the President.Featured image via YouTube"
" If You Love Veterans So Much, Trump, Why Did You Try To Sweep Them Into The Gutter?","According to Donald Trump, he loves veterans. At least that s what he keeps telling people. And when you re running in an election for a party that constantly uses the service of men and women and uniform as political props, you re going to tout the line that you love veterans as much as possible. However, actions speak louder than words, and Trump apparently doesn t realize that people actually remember the actions he took back in 1991 when he tried to remove veterans from 5th Avenue in New York City. You see, Trump Tower is on 5th Avenue, and those gosh darn veterans trying to make a living as vendors were just too unsightly for Trump to have anywhere near his precious building.In a letter Trump wrote to the New York state Assembly in 1991, it said: While disabled veterans should be given every opportunity to earn a living, is it fair to do so to the detriment of the city as a whole or its tax paying citizens and businesses? Do we allow Fifth Avenue, one of the world s finest and most luxurious shopping districts, to be turned into an outdoor flea market, clogging and seriously downgrading the area? And then again to NYC Mayor Mike Bloomberg in 2004: Whether they are veterans or not, they [the vendors] should not be allowed to sell on this most important and prestigious shopping street he image of New York City will suffer  I hope you can stop this very deplorable situation before it is too late. And in case that s not bad enough for you, he also wanted to make sure no one sat down near his building that may have taken away from the  beautiful ambience.  According to the New York Times he had large planters placed on benches. He said in 1984: We have had tremendous difficulties with respect to the bench   drug addicts, vagrants, et cetera have come to the atrium in large numbers. Additionally, all sorts of  horrors  had been taking place that effectively ruined the beautiful ambience of the space which everyone loves so much. To be blunt, Donald Trump is exactly what s wrong with the United States of America, and for him to even remotely be coming close to gaining the Republican nomination for president is outright horrifying. He only loves veterans when it s politically convenient for him to do so. To pander to a bunch of folks who are apparently so dumb to think he would actually make a decent president. His actions in the past with veterans only prove the continuing line that Trump is only out for himself and what s best for Trump. He doesn t want America to be great, because guess what, America is already pretty damn great. Trump wants Trump to be great, and he wants to stroke his ego inside the Oval Office. Smart Americans know better, and we need to make sure he stays as far away from the White House as possible.Featured image: Flickr/Wikimedia/photoshop"

LOL! CROOKED and IRRELEVANT HILLARY CLINTON GOES ON TOUR…Wait Till You See What She’s Asking Fans To Pay For Tickets,"Hillary Clinton will be back in the spotlight this fall for an unprecedented, big-ticket book tour for her new tome What Happened, with tickets priced as high as $1,200.On Monday, the ex-Democratic nominee announced  Hillary Clinton Live,  a 15-city tour, which includes stops in a handful of states she lost in the election last year.The astronomically priced tickets for Hillary s loser tour, certainly begs the question:  If no one came to see Hillary at her rallies (for free) when she was running for president, why would they pay $1,200 to hear the even more irrelevant Hillary Clinton whine about why she lost to Trump? Promotional materials for her first stop, at the Warner Theatre in Washington, D.C., promises Clinton plans to  let loose  and tell her audience a  personal, raw, detailed and surprisingly funny story  of her election loss and recovery.The website promoting the tour, HillaryClintonBookTour.com, features a quote from Clinton too. In the past, for reasons I try to explain, I ve often felt I had to be careful in public, like I was up on a wire without a net,  she said.  Now I m letting my guard down,  she pledged. The tour kicks off on September 18 in D.C. and continues on all through fall.Clinton is making stops in the trio of states that are largely blamed for her election loss: Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan.Clinton is hitting up a trio of Canadian cities too, making appearances in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver.Top-tier ticket packages in those cities cost $3,000 Canadian dollars for two seats, or, in American dollars, about $1,200 a pop.

 Trump’s Newest Foreign Policy Advisor Is One Of The Dumbest People To Ever Serve In Congress,"If you weren t having nightmares before about Donald Trump potentially having the nuclear codes, his latest choice for national security advisor should keep you up for months, or at least until November 9th. He has chosen, as a national security advisor, a woman who believes the earth is six million years old and that the world is ending very, very soon anyway. That woman is the former Congresswoman from Minnesota, Michele Bachmann.The campaign hasn t yet confirmed that Bachmann is advising on matters of foreign policy, but she is advising him on evangelical matters and she was, in a bit of tragic irony, part of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence when she was still in Congress. To some who have no idea about anything outside the borders of our country (Donald Trump), it would be logical to believe that she s an expert on foreign policy. She s not.As for her reputed position as a foreign policy advisor on Trump s team, Bachmann says this:The former Minnesota congresswoman attended a fundraiser in the state for Trump on Saturday, where she revealed to the press that she has his ear on foreign policy. He also recognizes there is a threat around the world, not just here in Minnesota, of radical Islam,  she said, according to MPR News.  I wish our President Obama also understood the threat of radical Islam and took it seriously. He s a common-sense guy, not into political correctness,  Bachmann added, according to the Star Tribune.Source: The HillLet s forget for a moment that Bachmann is a disaster on social issues. She hates gay people. She thinks the Founding Fathers outlawed slavery. She is anti-science. She s an anti-government conspiracy theorist. She thinks half of all African-American pregnancies end in abortion. She thinks that there would be no unemployment if there were no minimum wage. She thinks the U.S. is running out of rich people.As for her foreign expertise, she believes that the United States wants some sort of global currency. She believes Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. That would be Tel Aviv. She believes Sharia Law is around every corner. More significantly, she believes that there s no point in making the world a better place because Jesus will come vacuum everyone up to Heaven within the very near future. We know that there is more prophecy of Jesus  second coming even than there was in the first,  she said.  We also should be encouraged and empowered as believers in Jesus Christ   now more than ever   with the Bible in one hand, the newspaper in another, to say to our neighbors and co-workers and people at church, this is about the Lord speaking to the world that,  I am coming soon.

Henningsen: Obama White House Colluded with Facebook to Fabricate ‘Russian Bot’ Conspiracy,"WASHINGTON DC   This week the Senate Intelligence Committee finally gave an update on its continuing investigation into whether Russia actually had anything to do with the 2016 Election. If anyone was expecting any actual evidence to be presented, they would have been sorely disappointed, again. Still, that s not going to stop Official Washington from burning though more public money to try and prove a conspiracy theory.  The issue of collusion is still open,  said committee chairman, Richard Burr of North Carolina (R).  We have more work to do as it relates to collusion, but we re developing a clearer picture of what happened. Likewise, the committee s ranking Democrat, Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, admitted they had nothing, but implored Americans to  be on guard of the Russian. The Russian active measures did not end on Election Day 2016,  said Warner. He maintains that the US should adopt a  more aggressive  whole government  approach  to combat Russian influence on the vulnerable minds of unsuspecting Americans.However, yesterday 21WIRE revealed via Consortium News   that it was Senator Warner, along with the Obama White House, who colluded with Silicon Valley giant Facebook in 2016, with Warner making multiple trips to Palo Alto to pressure Facebook to produce some  evidence  that Warner and his colleagues could hold up as proof of  Russian Bots  using Facebook to interfere in the 2016 Election. As it turns out, this was fake news fabricated by Washington and its mainstream media partners.21WIRE editor Patrick Henningsen spoke to RT International yesterday about these developments, and how the US government is using their own fake news in order to shut down competition in the information sphere. By definition, that collusion between big government and corporations is classic fascism. Watch:.  What I will confirm is that the Russian intelligence service is determined, clever,  Senator Burr said.  And I recommend that every campaign and every election official take this very seriously.

He described the loss of the information as a  historic act of devastating incompetence. More on this report from RT  RTWikiLeaks will give tech companies which suffered  billions of dollars of damage  when hacked by the CIA  exclusive access  to its technical expertise, founder Julian Assange revealed at a press conference.Speaking in a livestream Thursday, Assange said the leaked information originated from an isolated computer, separated from others in the network, at CIA headquarters in Virginia, describing the loss of the information as an historic act of devastating incompetence.  READ MORE: WikiLeaks says just 1% of #Vault7 covert documents released so farRaising questions over whether the loss of the information was known to former US President Barack Obama or current president Donald Trump before being revealed by WikiLeaks, Assange also questioned if the loss had been shared with companies such as Apple and Google, which were made vulnerable by it. Potentially billions of dollars of damage  has been done by the CIA to tech companies, Assange said, adding trust has been damaged by the revelations, in both the US government and US exports. He later added that some of the fixes to devices exposed as vulnerable by the leak would be quickly fixed but others, including smart TVs, would be more difficult and take longer to fix. WikiLeaks has a lot more information,  Assange said, adding that  we have decided to work with them, to give them some exclusive access to some of the technical details we have, so that fixes can be pushed out.

AMERICAN UNIVERSITY HIRES Former Islamic Terror Recruiter: “I trust him” [VIDEO],"9-11 is a distant memory for liberals George Washington University has hired a former Islamic extremist to work at its center on homeland security   a man who once denounced the United States and made threats against the creators of the TV series  South Park  for depicting the Prophet Muhammad in a bear suit.While reformed extremists have worked at universities in Europe to help fight terrorism, this is believed to be a first in the United States.Jesse Morton, who was known as Younus Abdullah Muhammad when he was a recruiter for the al-Qaeda, brings a  unique perspective  to counter-terrorism work, said Seamus Hughes, deputy director of the Program on Extremism at George Washington University s Center for Cyber & Homeland Security .Watch Younus Abdullah Muhammad here:During his days as an extremist, Morton earned a master s degree in international affairs from Columbia University.Hughes said before making the hiring decision, he discussed Morton with the FBI, leaders in the security community and the lawyers that prosecuted Morton.He said he s sure Morton is completely reformed from the days he served time in federal prison after inciting people to join a terrorist organization. I trust him,  he said.  We did our due diligence. Nadia Oweidat, a fellow at the think tank New America who s interviewed dozens of former extremists, said she doesn t doubt Morton s sincerity. People go through phases. They evolve and are finally able to see the light,  she said.She doesn t think Morton made up his de-radicalization to get a shorter prison sentence. When an extremist defects, they risk being completely targeted by their community   it s like saying you re gay publicly,  she said.  There are life-altering consequences and you don t approach it lightly. She said other organizations should also recruit former extremists in the hopes of preventing future massacres such as the San Bernardino shooting or the November terror attack in Paris, both committed by radicalized Islamists.

US-UK DIRTY WAR: ‘Latin American-style’ Death Squads in Iraq Revealed Through Chilcot," Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireThis week another toxic revelation dripped from the Chilcot Report.According to top British SAS officers, US commander Stanley McChrystal s counter-insurgency  black-ops  featured a program of relentless violence designed to  speed up  the process of political cleansing and the so-called  reconstruction  of Iraq.What is so interesting here, is the Chilcot s choice of language, including the term  Latin American-style death squads , which by default implies the United States government was party to war crimes in Central America during the 1980 s   a claim which has always been strenuously denied in public, even though the general public and academia recognizes this to be a self-evident fact of America s long-running ugly history of intervention in that region.The Independent report reveals the level of sheer depravity by US command: The mission was an extraordinary set-up: inside the command centre    The Machine    was the  Death Star , on the walls of which were banks of television screens,  Kill TV , running live pictures of action taking place and surveillance footage in real time from which suspects could be picked out for future arrest or elimination. The Independent also detailed how reckless and violent practices by the US military caused noticeable divisions and splits between joint US-UK command structures and operations, including political tension between British military command.Through the newly created  Office of Special Plans , neoconservatives Paul Wolfowitz and Douglas Feith rolled out their own sub-layer to the US controlled shadow government in Iraq, including the establishment of the  Iraqi De Baathification Council  which, under the supervision of then US Viceroy Paul Bremer, began dismantling the Iraqi military, security and intelligence agency infrastructures of President Saddam Hussein. And so began the process of the Pentagon s  de-Baathification  process in Iraq, immediately followed by a hive of violent  Gangs and Counter-gangs  created by the US and UK covert military and intelligence apparatuses. Front and center in this effort were US operatives John Negroponte and his understudy at the time, Robert Ford, who was later dispatched as US Ambassador to Syria in the run-up to the Syrian Conflict which began in 2011.The legacy of this destructive policy still lingers in Iraq and now in Syria. This unquestionably spawned ISIS and many other terrorist factions in both Iraq and Syria. Only last week, Iraq saw its most deadly car bomb ever, a questionable  sectarian attack  (a narrative not challenged by the western and international press) which killed 200 innocent civilians, and injured many more. GLADIO REDUX: A map of every car bomb in Baghdad since the US-UK invasion in 2003 (Source: Twitter)Prof Michel Chossudovsky explains this same highly disturbing pattern that generally follows every US intervention overseas, be it overt or covert: The recruitment of death squads is part of a well established US military-intelligence agenda. There is a long and gruesome US history of covert funding and support of  terror brigades and targeted assassinations going back to the Vietnam war.   As government forces continue to confront the self-proclaimed  Free Syrian Army  (FSA),  the historical roots of  the West s covert war on Syria  which has resulted in countless atrocities  must be fully revealed.  Once again, we can see the revelation of the US-UK method of not simply instigating wars, but facilitating dirty wars not only overseas, but also at home, as in the case of Operation GLADIO and numerous other false flag events admittedly staged in North America.As 21WIRE will demonstrate in subsequent reports, this latest Chilcot revelation is only the tip of a much larger, covert iceberg RTHowever, kill or capture operations in and around Baghdad, launched from the Balad base 50 miles (80km) north of the city, were a key if little known chapter in Britain s shadow war, the Independent reports.Despite killing or taking as prisoner up to 3,500 insurgents, the mission against the Sunni insurgency caused deep rifts to the point where a senior commander, himself ex-SAS, demanded to know why the UK Special Forces were  helping to run Latin American-style death squads? The mission, under now-famed US General Stanley McChrystal, involved a shift from searching for apparently non-existent weapons of mass destruction (WMD) to man-hunting.Antagonism over the tactics led to UK troops being banned from some operations and a UK SAS commander lodging a complaint with US authorities for talking about British involvement in operations. Another SAS colonel was also ostracized from his regiment after serving under McCrystal.Chilcot does sketch out some of the details of the growing rift, though his report appears to leave out direct references to Special Forces operations. US and UK strategies had, in effect, been on different courses since the UK decision to focus its attention on MND (SE) [Multi-National Division South East, the British run zone] in 2003.As result of this decision, the UK had acquired distinctly different priorities from the US,  the 2.6-million-word report argues.It says the UK was then only  marginally involved in the central tasks of stabilizing the Iraqi government in Baghdad and managing sectarian divisions, while it had come to see its main task in Basra as one of keeping the situation calm while building the case for withdrawal. From that point on, it appears, the US became increasingly concerned that a wavering UK was chiefly focused on getting out of the unpopular war in the best order it could and as soon as possible.In 2006, a former SAS soldier blew the whistle on some of the tactics used in and around Baghdad. Ben Griffin was later gagged by the UK courts for talking about his experiences, but before he was silenced told the Telegraph,  The Americans had this catch-all approach to lifting suspects. The tactics were draconian and completely ineffective. The Americans were doing things like chucking farmers into Abu Ghraib [the notorious prison in Baghdad where US troops abused and tortured Iraqi detainees] or handing them over to the Iraqi authorities, knowing full well they were going to be tortured,  he said at the time.It may be of note that the SAS commander s reference to  Latin American-style deaths squads  appears to ignore the fact that at time of the Iraq war, in July 2003, the UK was itself stepping up training of Colombian paramilitary forces.Commenting on the revelations at the time, human rights NGO Amnesty International warned  the Colombian government has not implemented the UN human rights recommendations and military assistance only gives a green light to the army to carry on as before.

The group says the demands are necessary to  reduce the intolerable racism that students of color experience on campus every day.  Salovey is given until Nov. 18 to respond.As evidence of Yale s hostile racial climate, the demands cite a widely debunked alleged exclusion of black women from a party hosted at Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE) fraternity. There is substantial evidence this alleged segregation did not happen.Of the Yale student s demands, the most expensive is the third, which orders the school to increase the budget for Yale s four cultural centers (for Asians, blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians) by two million dollars each, a total expense of $8 million. Along with this increase to their budgets, the students demand that the cultural centers hire five additional full-time employees each. Via: Daily Caller "
"ACLU DEFENDS ILLEGALS? SUES DOJ, ICE Over Arrests of Illegal Alien Teen Gangs: “That was play-fighting”","WHO IS THE ACLU PROTECTING? Certainly not the legal citizens of America!After Obama allowed and even encouraged thousands upon thousands of unaccompanied illegal alien minors to flood America, we re now responsible for the mess he created.  MS13 gang members have been going on killing sprees that have been terrorizing Americans. President Trump has a policy in place that simply enforces the law! Read below and let us know if you agree that the ACLU is protecting people who should have no rights in America.The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed a class action lawsuit against President Trump s administration over the detention of immigrant teenagers for  unsubstantiated claims of gang affiliation. The lawsuit, announced on Friday, targets Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Department of Health and Human Services  Office of Refugee Resettlement.In a press release, the ACLU accuses ICE and the Office of Refugee Resettlement of detaining children and transporting them to detention facilities without notifying their parents or lawyers.The organization also alleges that ICE is detaining and deporting the immigrant teens  under the guise of a  crackdown  on transnational street gangs  and accuses the federal agency of making arrests based on  unreliable claims of gang affiliation and flawed reports of criminal history.   We re talking about teens who were picked up for play-fighting with a friend, or for showing pride in their home country of El Salvador,  Stephen Kang, an attorney with the ACLU Immigrants  Rights Project, said in the release.  The Office of Refugee Resettlement is accepting wholesale that young immigrants should be kept behind bars because of what they look like or where they come from. The lead plaintiffs in the case are from Suffolk County in Long Island, N.Y.In May, ICE announced it has arrested more than 1,300 people in a crackdown on gangs. Three of those arrested had Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals paperwork protecting them from deportation, according to a report at the time by The Washington Post.The crackdown on gangs coupled with the Trump administration s tough stance on legal and illegal immigration has raised alarms among activists that people with tenuous connections to gangs could come under unfair scrutiny.Fox News reported a surge in people seeking to remove tattoos that people believed could be used by ICE to link them to gangs.The ACLU class action lawsuit seeks the release of the teens who are the plaintiffs in the case as well as an injunction to prevent the government from further detaining immigrant children without cause.The ACLU has launched numerous lawsuits against Trump s administration since he took office, suing over Trump s travel ban and challenging the legality of his voter fraud commission.WHO IS THE ACLU PROTECTING?

WOW! WHAT JOHN KASICH Just Asked Cruz And Trump To Do Proves He’s Got An Ego The Size Of Texas,"John Kasich is delusional! He s also full of himself! It s unbelievable that he came in fourth in a three man race but still insists on continuing his run for president. Give it up! Donald Trump and Ted Cruz should suspend their campaigns and  consolidate  behind John Kasich, John Kasich suggested this morning during an appearance on Meet the Press. Ted Cruz s campaign is repeatedly called for you to get out,  host Chuck Todd said.  Saying a vote for you is a vote for Donald Trump.   If you thought your position in this race strengthened Trump, would you get out? Chuck, I m beating Hillary by 11 points,  Kasich replied.  I m the only one that can win in the fall. And as you noticed the narrative over the last week has been what is wrong with the party. Kasich s the guy that can win the general. Some people have said Kasich would be the best president. Get out for what?  he continued.  If I d gotten out Trump would be the nominee, he would have won Ohio. And frankly, we ll win some districts in Wisconsin. We will move to Pennsylvania where I m basically in a statistical tie with Trump. And when we go to New York and everywhere else, we re going to pick up delegates,  Kasich predicted.  It s absurd, it s absurd. You know, if you really want, let them consolidate behind me because frankly I m the one that can win in the fall. And I m the one that can get the crossover votes.

 Trump Threw Mar-A-Lago Fundraiser For Woman At The Center Of Bribery Scandal,"Just a few days after she made the decision to let an investigation of Donald Trump s Trump University slide, the former reality TV star held a fundraiser for Florida attorney general Pam Bondi at his palatial Mar-A-Lago compound.News of the cash-fueled party comes as Trump faces renewed criticism after being fined by the IRS after it came to light that the Trump Foundation illegally funneled money into Bondi s re-election campaign.In March 2014, Donald Trump opened his 126-room Palm Beach resort, Mar-a-Lago, for a $3,000-per-person fundraiser for Pam Bondi. The Florida attorney general, who was facing a tough re-election campaign, had recently decided not to investigate Trump University.Trump did not write a check to the attorney general that night. The previous fall, his personal foundation had given $25,000 to a pro-Bondi PAC. But by hosting her fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago and bringing in some of his own star power, Trump provided Bondi s campaign with a nice financial boost.The Huffington Post also reports that while Trump has billed the RNC $140,000 per event to use his mansion, he only charged the Republican Party of Florida $4,855.65. That means that Trump stands to make a windfall simply by controlling the flow of campaign donor money to his own enterprises.News of the interlocking relationship between Trump and Bondi (she has done campaign rallies for him) underscores how the national media has ignored or played down actual stories of Trump and his involvement with corruption. Instead they have banged the drums on the Clinton Foundation, making allegations of wrong-doing based on the potential and  optics  of the far-reaching charity the Clintons put in place.Trump is also implicated in similar behavior in Texas. The attorney general there dropped looking into Trump University a little after he gave him a financial donation.Featured image via Flickr"

RUBIO Sides With Democrats On Giving A Whopping $2 Billion For Zika Virus Prevention,"Democrats want to spend a whopping $2 billion on zika virus prevention. Republicans are demanding more controls so Rubio is calling them stingy with federal dollars. Is this guy really a Republican? Just two months after running as one of the conservative candidates in the GOP presidential race, Sen. Marco Rubio is now embracing Democrats  calls to open the federal checkbook and dole out billions of dollars in money to combat the Zika virus   and tacking it onto the debt.Mr. Rubio, whose home state of Florida is at risk of a serious outbreak, is co-sponsoring legislation to fully fund President Obama s nearly $2 billion emergency spending request, and blasted his fellow Republicans for being too stingy by demanding more proof and more controls.And Mr. Rubio, who is finishing out his first term then ditching the Senate at the end of this year, said if the new spending can be offset, that s fine. But he s also fine with tacking it onto the debt and leaving it for others to pay for.  In times of public health emergencies, just like natural disasters, we shouldn t delay acting while we figure out and try to agree on what we re going to cut from other parts of the budget,  he said in a floor speech last week.Mr. Rubio gives Democrats political cover as Congress prepares to fight this week over the mosquito-borne Zika virus, which health experts say hasn t had a breakout in the U.S. yet, but fear one is looming as the summer heats up.The House GOP released its own plan Monday that would allocate $622 million toward Zika, taking the money from existing Ebola money and elsewhere.Read more: WT"
 Ben & Jerry Tell Us Why Pulling Out Of Paris Climate Deal Was The Right Move,"Ben and Jerry, the  ber liberal Vermont ice cream guys, are no fans of Donald Trump and in a blistering and sarcastic op-ed, they sarcastically explained how pulling out of the Paris climate treaty was the right thing to do.The op-ed, on their website, is tongue-in-cheek, but also bitter (a terrible suggestion for a Ben & Jerry s flavor). They talk about the jobs that will be lost:We hear China is ramping up their renewable energy production and it sure looks like a lot of work. Beijing alone plans to invest $360 billion in renewables by 2020, creating more than 13 million jobs. But jobs are work! Work is hard! It s so much easier to luxuriate in the status quo, driving our fossil-fuel-powered cars and enjoying our coal-created electricity like we always have.It s also quite personal for them. The cost of cocoa beans and vanilla will rise dramatically over the coming years.Then, there s the fact that we are one of only three countries who have chosen not to participate. That means we will no longer have a seat at the table and it means that for all intents and purposes, we can no longer call ourselves a superpower.Ben & Jerry go on to talk about the wonderful ocean views we ll all soon have:Who doesn t love oceanfront property? With runaway climate change melting glaciers and causing sea levels to rise at unprecedented rates, a whole lot more of us could be seeing waves from our bedroom windows. Sure, some folks might lose their homes and businesses, and our coastal cities could see devastating changes, but a whole lot of people will also be able to learn how to surf right in their backyards. Sounds like a fair tradeoff to us.They also look forward to the impending world crises, which make  life exciting. We can see it now:  13.1 Million US Homes Flooded   Boat Sales Surge,   World Refuses to Cooperate with US Foreign Policy, US Sulks Like Angsty Teenager,  and  Hundreds of Plants and Animals Now Extinct, US Says  We Never Liked Polar Bears Anyway. Then, there s the fact that the world is ready to take the reins, with or without us. We are the second largest emitter of greenhouse gasses and we are leaving it up to everyone else to clean up our messes.Featured image via theimpulsiovebuy/Flickr"
WILL AND GRACE Writers Explain How Their HATE For PRESIDENT TRUMP Inspired Them To Bring Show Back After 11 Years [VIDEO],"When Will & Grace creators David Kohan and Max Mutchnick reunited the stars of the NBC comedy in fall 2016, more than 10 years after its finale, a reboot was not on their minds.  There was not one word about,  Let s figure out a way to do this again!    insists Kohan, 53. The pair were so sure that the project   a video in support of then-candidate Hillary Clinton   would be their last with the gang that they hired a film crew  as a way to memorialize the event for our daughters,  explains Mutchnick, 51.But NBC Entertainment chairman Bob Greenblatt had other plans. Less than two weeks later, the creators were back at the NBC commissary discussing a revival. The multicam returns Thursday, Sept. 28, for season nine, with a tenth season already greenlighted.Picking up  11 years later,  as the season premiere title suggests, the new episodes will largely ignore the events of the series finale, in which Will (Eric McCormack) and Grace (Debra Messing) both married, had kids and went their separate ways. Instead, the two are single and living together, still, with Jack (Sean Hayes) across the hall and Karen (Megan Mullally) just as rich and outrageous as ever.The other big change since the foursome last graced the small screen? The new president in the White House   despite Kohan and Mutchnick s best efforts on Clinton s behalf.  There s a lot of tension in the air, so there s a lot of things to write and there are a lot of reasons to make an audience laugh,  Mutchnick says.  THR3 weeks before the election, Will and Grace s writers produced a video using the cast the show s former cast to beg liberal viewers to vote for Hillary. The entire 9 minute and 37-second video was created for the sole purpose of trashing then-candidate President Trump. David Kohan From Bob Greenblatt were so inspired by the number of Trump-hating liberals who viewed their video received, that they decided to start the series back up again.The video includes classy lines from Will about then-candidate Trump being a  dick . When Grace reminds Will that the election is  all going to come down to undecided Pennsylvania s voters anyway, to which Will replies:  Right, the unemployed, uneducated, angry white man.   And there you have it, the arrogance of the liberal Hollywood writer, who expects Americans to sit down once a week and watch themselves be mocked and berated, as the writers refer to middle-America as UNEDUCATED, UNEMPLOYED, ANGRY WHITE MEN Watch the video that inspired the writers to bring back the angry new Trump-bashing sitcom: "
 Here’s The Latest Reason Conservatives Are Calling Michelle Obama A N***** (SCREENSHOTS),"It s official: No one in the Obama family can do or say anything without the Stupid Part of America calling them n*ggers. As she gave her final, powerful commencement speech as First Lady, Michelle Obama dropped a harsh truth on the graduating class of CUNY   the White House was built largely using slave labor: It s the story that I witness every single day, when I wake up in a house that was built by slaves. And I watch my daughters two beautiful, black young women head off to school waving goodbye to their father, the President of the United States, the son of a man from Kenya who came here to American to America for the same reasons as many of you: To get an education and improve his prospects in life. Obama is correct. WhiteHousehistory.org notes that black people provided much of the labor that went into building the White House after the U.S. government failed to find qualified workers they could pay to do the work (slave masters were, of course, paid):The D.C. commissioners, charged by Congress with building the new city under the direction of the president, initially planned to import workers from Europe to meet their labor needs. However, response to recruitment was dismal and soon they turned to African American enslaved and free to provide the bulk of labor that built the White House, the United States Capitol, and other early government buildings.Stonemason Collen Williamson trained enslaved people on the spot at the government s quarry at Aquia, Virginia. Enslaved people quarried and cut the rough stone that was later dressed and laid by Scottish masons to erect the walls of the President s House. The slaves joined a work force that included local white laborers and artisans from Maryland and Virginia, as well as immigrants from Ireland, Scotland, and other European nations.The uneducated f*ckwits at Young Conservatives, naturally, complained that the First Lady  whined  about that little slavery issue that we should pretend never happened, calling her  ungrateful  and informing their readers that Obama is  ungrateful  because she correctly noted the history of her current home. You know, Michelle   if you don t like living there, move out,  writes blogger John. S. Roberts, who wonders why  some people  (read:  the blacks ) just  can t move beyond  the fact that their ancestors were owned by white people.Naturally, commenters agreed, calling the First Lady a  n*gger  because that s pretty much the extent of their intelligence. They, too, think she is  ungrateful  because white people did her a favor by shipping her ancestors over here and forcing them to work and endure brutal beatings, rapes, and murders:         Over at right-wing propaganda mill, Weazel Zippers, the sentiment was the same   and they didn t need to write a single word. They just pasted a screenshot of a tweet about the statement.              Conservatives are horrible   and, unfortunately, each and every single one of them will be headed to the polls in November to vote for Trump. We can not allow someone who fosters this sort of hatred to succeed President Obama. Be sure to get out and do your duty in November   vote BLUE across the board and kick the haters out of their respective offices.Featured image via screen capture"
 Obama’s Attorney General Just Spit In Trump’s Face Over 9th Circuit Court Ruling,"With the 9th Circuit Court ruling against the Trump administration and in favor of Washington State, Minnesota, and by proxy everyone else that was harmed by his Muslim ban, we have the inevitable rage-fest from Trump, along with people who are spitting in his face and stomping on his pride because they agree with the courts.One of the people who probably agrees with how the courts have been ruling is Sally Yates, the acting attorney general that Trump fired because she refused to enforce the ban. Trump didn t just quietly let her go, though. He accused her of betraying her department, and implied that she d betrayed the U.S.Now, enter Eric Holder. He was Obama s attorney general before Loretta Lynch, and spearheaded Department of Justice investigations into controversial things, such as whether the police department in Ferguson, Missouri was guilty of racial profiling, among other things. Holder, of course, also seems to believe that Trump s Muslim ban was a bad idea.So he, too, is rubbing the 9th Circuit s decision in Trump s face because, surprise surprise, Yates was vindicated in her decision to refuse to enforce the Muslim ban. Here s what Holder posted to Twitter:Skill, judgment, courgage. VINDICATED. 3-0 pic.twitter.com/5A2uPTXRps  Eric Holder (@EricHolder) February 10, 2017Yup.Trump has called the decision political, because of course he thinks that way. He said as much to the White House press corps off-camera:Listen to audio of President Trump reacting to appeals court ruling against reinstating his travel ban executive order. via @KellyO pic.twitter.com/WZEMXxKlM5  NBC News (@NBCNews) February 10, 2017He also took to Twitter to vow, in all caps, to see his opponents on this in court, meaning he ll try to appeal this to the Supreme Court. The best thing that could happen would be for the Supreme Court to decline to even hear the case.In the meantime, Sally Yates is vindicated, and Trump can go suck it.Read more:Featured image by Aaron P.

 Trump Explodes At Smiling Protester: ‘I’d Like To Punch Him In The Face’ (VIDEO),"A few weeks ago, Rachel Maddow did a comparison of Donald Trump and notorious racist George Wallace on her show. One of the points she made about the 2016 candidate and the 1968 candidate is how violent they both are. Like George Wallace, Trump is able to get his crowds riled up into such a frenzy that they start attacking protesters. At the beginning of his campaign, The Donald would do it by screeching  GET HIM OUTTA HERE,  but during a recent event, he actually said he d like to punch a protester in the face.During a campaign event in Nevada on Monday night, Trump flipped out after he was interrupted by some hecklers and said: You know what I hate? There s a guy, totally disruptive, throwing punches   we re not allowed to punch back anymore. In the old days, you know what they used to do with guys like that when they were in a place like this? They d be carried out on a stretcher, folks. Yeah, that imbecile thinks that protesting at one of his events warrants being  carried out on a stretcher.  But he wasn t finished. When one of the protesters was removed by security, the man was smiling and this really pissed Trump off, he said, I d like to punch him in the face, I ll tell you that. There s a guy throwing punches, nasty as hell, screaming and everything else when we re talking, and we re talking out   we re not allowed, the guards are very gentle with him, he s walking, like, big high fives, smiling, laughing   I d like to punch him in the face. According to Politico security admitted that nobody was  throwing punches.  Instead, it looks like Trump made that up to justify his violent words. This is, of course, not surprising coming from a man who once applauded his supporters for kicking and punching a Black Lives Matter protester. It is, however, frightening that this man is in first place in the GOP polls. A man who stands on a stage and incites violence. A man who that is how a president should behave. This is what the Republican Party is offering up to the country: a schoolyard bully. Seriously? And they wonder why their party is slowly dying Watch:Featured image via video screenshot"
Reflections on a World Gone Mad and Pushing Back against Neocolonialist Thuggery," Andre Vltchek Anti DiplomaticoThe following is an interview with ANDRE VLTCHEK by ALESSANDRO BIANCCHI, Chief Editor of the Italian political magazine Anti-Diplomatico:ALESSANDRO BIANCHI: Self-determination of peoples and respect for the borders and sovereignty of a country. This is of the most complicated issue for international law. How can it be articulated for the case of Catalonia?ANDRE VLTCHEK: Personally, I m not very enthusiastic about smaller nations forming their own states, particularly those in the West, where they would, after gaining  independence , remain in the alliances that are oppressing and plundering the entire world: like NATO or the European Union.Clearly, the breaking of the great country of Yugoslavia into small pieces was a hostile, evil design by the West, and particularly of Germany and Austria. The dissolution of Czechoslovakia after the so-called  Velvet Revolution  was a total idiocy.But Catalonia (or Basque Country), if it became independent, would become one of the richest parts of Europe. I don t think it would have any great positive or negative impact on the rest of the world. As an internationalist, I don t really care if they are separate from Spain or not, or whether they are even richer than they already are, as I care much more about what is happening in places such as Afghanistan, Venezuela or North Korea.On the other hand, the way Spain has now behaved in Catalonia, after the referendum, is a total disgrace. They decided to treat the Catalan people in the same way as Indonesians have been treating Papuans for decades. If this continues, it will all reach the point of no return: reconciliation will become impossible. You cannot start sexually harassing women and then break their fingers, one by one, just because they want to have their own state. You cannot injure hundreds of innocent people, who simply don t want to be governed from Madrid. That s absurd and thoroughly sick! Of course Spain used to commit holocausts all over what is now called Latin America, so it is  in their blood . But I don t think Catalans will allow this to be done to them.What about the constitution of Spain? Look, there should be nothing sacred about constitutions. In the West, they were written to protect the interests of the ruling classes. When they get outdated, they should be moderated, or totally rewritten. If Catalans or Basques want their independence, if they really want it, if it is so important for them, then why not   they should have it. Spain is not a  people s country . It is an oppressive Western bully. I would have a totally different position if some part of Bolivia or China were to try to secede.AB: Different situation and different reality. Another issue of fundamental international concern in this period is the referendum of Iraqi Kurdistan, which is likely to become the new fuse ready to explode in that area. Would it be the new Israel in the Middle East as someone has affirmed?AV: Well, that is really a very serious issue. I have worked in the Kurdish autonomous region of Iraq already twice, even on the  border  with Mosul, and what I saw there I did not like at all!It is clearly a  client  state of the West, of Turkey and to some extent, Israel. It is shamelessly capitalist, taking land from its own people, cheating them, just in order to pump and refine huge quantities of oil. It treats Syrian refugees like animals, forcing them to make anti-Assad statements. It is turning ancient Erbil into some bizarre shopping mall with nothing public in sight. Its military top brass is mainly US/UK-trained and indoctrinated. And it provokes Baghdad, day and night.I really strongly disliked what I saw there. If Iraqi Kurds were allowed to have their  independence , the impact on the region would be huge and certainly negative. Baghdad should not allow it, even at the cost of an armed confrontation.AB: Coming to the question of the moment: the nuclear escalation in North Korean and a possible escalation of war on the Korean peninsula. What is your opinion about Kim s strategy and what are the real risks?AV: There is only one real  risk  and danger: that the world is quickly accepting as inevitable the fact that the Western thuggish regimes can get away with absolutely anything. I see no other serious problem that the world today is facing.What is Kim s strategy? To defend his people by all means, against the brutal force that has already murdered millions of men, women and children of Korea. That brutal force is the West and its allies. It is all very simple, but only if one is willing to turn off the BBC and to use his or her own brain, it becomes  obvious .AB: According to many, for Pyongyang the nuclear bomb is becoming more and more vital because it is increasingly feared that the country will end up like Iraq and Libya. Do you not believe that the sanctions of the United Nations are therefore totally ineffective and counterproductive because they fuel this escalation?AV: Of course, but they [sanctions] are still imposed on the victim! It is because almost no one dares to laugh straight in the faces of Western demagogues and dictators. The world resembles the areas occupied by the Nazi Germany and Italy and Japan during the WWII. There, nobody would dare to vote independently, defending victims of fascism.AB: The US Federation of Science (FAS) estimates that in 2017 North Korea has  fissile material to potentially produce 10 to 20 nuclear warheads  even if it is strongly suspected that none can be considered ready for launch. The US possesses 6,800 nuclear heads. The French and British (respectively 300 and 215 respectively) included, NATO s nuclear forces have 7,315 nuclear warheads, of which 2,200 are ready to launch, compared to 7,000 held by the Russians, of which 1,950 are ready to launch. With Chinese (270), Pakistani (120-130), Indian (110-120) and Israeli (80), the total number of nuclear warheads is estimated to be around 15,000 by default. The West is a nuclear oligopoly that can only create an escalation with those who feel threatened, and so the threatened search to procure them. Is North Korea the only source of nuclear threat to the world, as it seems in the mainstream media?AV: Of course, North Korea is no threat at all. I have already spoken about it during countless televised interviews. I visited North Korea and mingled with its people. There, nobody wants war. The North Korean people paid a terrible price for their independence. Its civilians were murdered mercilessly in tunnels by Western forces; its women were brutally raped, entire villages and towns leveled to the ground, or burned to ashes. All this is never discussed in the West, but is remembered in North Korea.Now, absolutely shameless British propaganda is  preparing  the world public for the  inevitability  of the war. You know, if someone in this day and age still believes that the United States is the only culprit, he or she is perhaps living in some deep isolated trench or a cave. Indoctrination and brainwashing is mainly designed,  Made in Europe , most evidently in the UK, where most of the people have already lost all their ability to think rationally. The British colonialist propaganda apparatus is terribly sinister, but strategically it is simply brilliant! It was utilized for centuries, and it even succeeded in  programming  the brains of the victims in the sub-Continent, Africa and elsewhere.Of course, your numbers are correct and all that is happening is thoroughly absurd! But day and night people are told that North Korea represents a true danger to the world. The same was said about the Soviet Union, China, Cuba, Iraq, Afghanistan and many other countries. Most of these countries have already been destroyed.North Korea s sin is that it refuses to surrender, to fall on its knees, to sacrifice its people. It refuses to become a slave. For centuries, European and later US colonialism punished such defiance in the most brutal ways. Western culture is, after all, based and built on slavery. It demands absolute compliance, unconditional submission.If North Korea is attacked, it should fight back! And it will.AB: The United Nations adopted the important Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in July. The United Nations is often used (in alternate ways and countries): this Treaty is ignored by all nuclear powers, including by members of NATO with US nuclear weapons (including Italy). NATO has banned member states from ratifying it. Can the West have a moralist attitude to those who pursue a deterrent in order not to not end up like Saddam and Gaddafi?AV: The West is like an army of brigands that has managed to overrun some city, to rape everything that moves, burn the center, loot houses and shops and then execute all leading thinkers and defenders. A few days later they see someone stealing a bunch of bananas from a fruit stall. And they catch him, and judge him, and feel totally morally righteous. It is all so comical! But that is not how you are supposed to see it!AB: Russia and China (with Iran, Venezuela and many other countries) are intensifying de-dollarization in their mutual exchanges. Does it envisage a gradual weakening of the dollar capable of affecting international finance and what geopolitical repercussions?AV: Yes, definitely! And you should talk about it to my friend, Peter Koenig, a true dissident, a former economist at the World Bank, who is now actually advising many countries on de-dollarization.US dollars should not be used anymore. Western institutions should be ignored. Totally new structures should be, and are being erected. China and Russia are, of course, in the lead. All this is extremely important and can change the world, in the near future.AB: Venezuela, with the convening of the Constituent Assembly, turned off the coup attempts of the opposition. In Brazil Lula is favored in polls, while in Argentina the former President Cristina Fernandez is back in the Senate with strong popular support. So it was not the end of the progressive cycle, as the mainstream has for years stated?AV: Of course it was not the end! The desire of Lain Americans to live in just and egalitarian societies is too strong; it cannot be destroyed overnight.There were some serious setbacks   in Argentina and Brazil. And Venezuela is suffering immensely, battered by its own shameless elites sponsored from abroad. But the country is still standing.In Brazil, Temer is immensely unpopular. His  constitutional coup  will soon backfire. PT will be back, in its old form or in a new one. And it will be much stronger than before. The same goes for Argentina. You see, despite all the media manipulation, propaganda and shameless lies, people are already realizing that they were fooled. They want some decency back, they want socialism and pride and hope! They want true independence.In two weeks from now I m going back to South America. My book of essays is being published by LOM, soon, and LOM is a very important left-wing publishing house in Chile. These days I go back to South America often. It is one of the frontlines, battlegrounds, where people struggle against Western imperialism and its lackeys!These are very important, fascinating times!

LET THEM EAT CAKE: Obama Dines In Parisian Splendor At ‘Working Dinner’ [Video],"The green criminals who re working on how to distribute your money to those in far away places had a splendid meal last night in Paris. Could someone tell Obama we re broke?As working dinners go, President Obama s meal Monday night in Paris with French President Francois Hollande, Secretary of State John Kerry and others wasn t too shabby.No cartons of takeout   instead, the gang fueled up after a long day of climate talks at L Ambroisie, the three-Michelin-starred temple of gastronomie in the Marais neighborhood.Per the Michelin Guide, the ornately be-chandelier-ed dining room is known for  incomparable classicism and an immortal feast for the senses. Perhaps worried that Obama would create an international faux pas by ordering a burger or a margarita (two of his faves), a reporter asked what he planned to eat. Obama was, appropriately, diplomatic:  I will get recommendations from the president,  he answered, nodding in Hollande s direction.According to the AP, Obama cracked a joke about the opulence of the setting.  Don t break the chandelier,  he warned as a reporter s microphone got just a little too close to the crystal.  You can t afford it. "

HILLARY’S LAP DOG VA Senator Tim Kaine Calls For VIOLENCE In The Streets To COMBAT TRUMP [VIDEO],"Can anyone imagine a sitting Republican Senator calling for violence or fighting in the streets in opposition to a newly elected Democratic President? On Tuesday Democratic Senator Time Kaine told the Morning Joe in an interview that Democrats need to fight the Trump administration including online and on the streets in addition to  the ballot box.Partial Transcript:MIKA BRZEZINSKI, CO-HOST  MORNING JOE : So, broad question about the future of the Democratic Party, especially given your firsthand experience with what we ve all been through. There s so much going on here that we clearly see, you know, places where you   we can criticize what the administration is doing, but how does the party rebuild? How do you prevent overreach in a situation like this? How do you prevent a continuation of the bubble in a situation like this, and how does the party reclaim its reach across the country while fighting these battles? SEN. TIM KAINE (D-VA): So, the way we get outside the bubble is we take advantage of this tremendous public outcry against the administration. What we ve got to do is fight in Congress, fight in the courts, fight in the streets, fight online, fight at the ballot box, and now there s the momentum to be able to do this. And we re not afraid of the popular outcry, we re energized by it and that s going to help us do our job and do it better.  -GPListen to faux man Tim Kaine call for fighting on the streets here. Pay special attention to his comment about the  Women s March  that  was organized under a grassroots  label.'  It sounds like Kaine s admitting that it was organized under a grassroots  label  but that it wasn t really grassroots at all. Why didn t he just come out and admit that it was organized by Soros, Obama and Planned Parenthood?We could also add the DNC s California Chair: In a sign of the vigor of the party s distaste for the president, outgoing party Chair John Burton, a longtime Democratic lawmaker and powerbroker known for his blunt and profane manner, extended two middle fingers in the air as the crowd cheered and joined him. F  Donald Trump,  he said:Outgoing @ca_dem chair @Johnburton gets standing O w final words to his party, finger upraised:  F@ck Donald Trump!  pic.twitter.com/VIqNQlhDJc  Carla Marinucci (@cmarinucci) May 20, 2017And we though Tom Perez was bad: Tom Perez must not have taken the class about winning friends and influencing people. How can you win over voters with such bitterness and anger? The Democrat Party has sunk to a new low with this classless thug. Who goes out there and speaks like this? We reported (see below) on the last speech Perez gave and he said the same nasty things. What gives? Are the deems so desperate that they re now resorting to profanity-filled speeches that make false claims about Republicans and President Trump? We think it s a losing strategy!"
PRICELESS! WATCH MSNBC HOST’S Shocked Response When GOP Lawmaker Calls For “Purge” of “Deep State” FBI and DOJ,"THIS IS PRICELESS! The video below shows just how out of control the left is when it comes to the corruption within the FBI and DOJ.When a Republican lawmaker called for a  purge  of what he said are  deep state  elements within the FBI and Justice Department, the MSNBC host Hallie Jackson was clearly agitated and shocked: I m very concerned that the DOJ and the FBI, whether you call it deep state or what, are off the rails,  Florida Rep. Francis Rooney stated then cited reasons behind his concern. The anti-Trump bias and the demotion of Bruce Ohr were just two of the examples Rooney gave.Jackson shot back,  Congressman, you just called the FBI and the DOJ off the rails. Something that you re okay with talking about here? How does that not sort of undermine the work that the agencies are doing? I don t want to discredit them. I would like to see the directors of those agencies purge it,  said Rooney.  And say look, we ve got a lot of great agents, a lot of great lawyers here, those are the people that I want the American people to see and know the good works being done, not these people who are kind of the deep state. Jackson responded:  Language like that, Congressman, purge? Purge the Department of Justice? Rooney responded,  Well, I think that Mr. Strzok could be purged, sure. Ms. Jackson might want to read up on the corruption that s been uncovered so far with the FBI and DOJ."
 A MASSIVE Screw Up May Have Just Cost Trump The Nomination – And It’s All His Fault,"The people insisting the only thing standing in the way of Donald Trump s path to the nomination is Donald Trump himself may have finally been vindicated. In an explosive story first broken by TIME, Republican officials in South Carolina floated the idea that Trump may have given away his landslide victory in the state by brashly announcing that he would no longer adhere to the  Loyalty Pledge  if he didn t get the nomination.South Carolina Republican Party Chairman Matt Moore gave credence to the anti-Trump claims. Breaking South Carolina s presidential primary ballot pledge raises some unanswered legal questions that no one person can answer,  he told TIME.  However, a court or national convention Committee on Contests could resolve them. It could put delegates in jeopardy. What does this mean for Trump? The 50 delegates he won in South Carolina could simply walk away   and over to his opponents. That sends his delegate count a lot further away from the crucial 1,237 finish line, and maybe give his opponents the push they need to realistically challenge him at a brokered convention. And adding to the problem: Other states which include the loyalty pledge in their bylaws could also move to strip Trump of his delegates.All of this to say, Trump s massive ego is costing him the election. Having early on floated the idea that he wouldn t support a Republican candidate if it wasn t himself, Trump eventually caved and signed a document stating: I, Donald J. Trump, affirm that if I do not win the 2016 Republican nomination for President of the United States I will endorse the 2016 Republican nominee regardless of who it is. Suddenly, with opposition to his nomination mounting, Trump has returned to saying he will not adhere to that pledge, telling Anderson Cooper matter-of-factly:  No. I don t anymore,  arguing that he s been treated unfairly by the GOP.Trump has repeatedly ignored conventional wisdom and used his gut to direct his campaign   early on, Trump s campaign manager told staffers that the motto of the campaign would be  Let Trump Be Trump    and while it often works to his advantage (who would have thought calling John McCain a loser for being a POW would pay off?), his increasingly erratic behavior makes him a ticking time bomb. Cracks are beginning to emerge. His polls are tanking and there are signs that the  anti-Trump  members of the Republican Party are finally coalescing around his chief rival, Ted Cruz. He may have enough momentum to get the nod, but needlessly handing away delegates isn t doing him any favors.In the end there was only one serious contender against Trump and that was himself. For all of his arrogance, it is fitting that his own misplaced hubris would be the one thing that got the better of him. Having run as an outsider for his entire campaign, Trump is learning that bashing the party you plan to run for isn t welcomed with open arms. They let Trump be Trump and he didn t disappoint.Featured image via Darren Hauck/Getty Images "
 Speaker Of The Big House: Child Molester Dennis Hastert To Spend Over A Year In Jail,"Former Speaker Of The House Dennis Hastert got handed the sentence of 15 months in prison for monetary payoffs he made to keep his sexual abuse of young boys silent. The judge in the case called him a  serial child molester,  and also ordered him to enroll in a sex-offender treatment program.Hastert was accused of molesting 4 boys aged 14 to 17, during his time as a coach at Yorkville High School in Illinois. The case came to light when one of them finally broke decades of silence on Hastert s conduct.If you re thinking 15 months for molesting 4 boys is outrageous, you d be correct. Unfortunately, the statute of limitations has expired on the molestation cases. This forced the court to focus on illegal cash withdrawals that Hastert made to pay hush-money in order to keep the crimes buried.As is always the case with your average Republican who does something criminal, there is a news reel of them being hypocritical by attacking others for somewhat similar conduct. Hastert was a very vocal critic of then-President Bill Clinton over the Monica Lewinsky affair. Clearly, Bill was not in any sense as despicable as Hastert. However, that didn t stop Hastert from strongly attacking Clinton for it.Dennis Hastert on the House floor, 1998:When the allegations first came to light, Hastert did what all Republicans do; blame the victim. His initial response was to claim that the money withdrawal was because HE was the one being victimized by a blackmailer over a baseless claim of sexual abuse. This didn t end up working well for Hastert because the judge used it to hand down an even stronger sentence to him, with the judge telling him,  You tried to make him a victim again. U.S. Attorney comments on Hastert:This is yet another case of the universal hypocrisy that is a chronic condition of the Republican party. During a time when Republicans everywhere are trying to pass bathroom laws to  protect people  from the theorized molestations they believe will occur if a transgender individual uses a public bathroom, their party heroes keep getting nailed for doing the very thing they claim to hate.Here s a better idea. Since Republican men do this more than transgender individuals, we will make a  Republican Men s Bathroom.  We can do voter ID checks to make sure Republican men can only use their assigned bathroom because it s a  public safety issue,  as they like to say regarding their anti-LGBT bathroom laws. While we re at it, we can make Republican male-only movie theaters, restaurants and stores to help protect the public from mass shooters.Featured Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images"
DISRESPECTFUL DEMS EXPOSED! You’ll Never Guess Who Also Boycotted George W. Bush’s Inauguration [VIDEO],"It s a free country, and the nineteen (and counting) members of Congress who are planning to boycott President-elect Trump s inauguration are certainly within their rights. So even is Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., who said over the weekend that Trump s election (or his presidency) is  illegitimate. That doesn t make his comment true or honorable or helpful to the nation s well-being, but he is free to say it.Reps. Lewis, Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., Barbara Lee, D-Calif., Katherine Clark, D-Mass., and the other inaugural boycotters are certainly not alone in finding Trump uniquely awful. They are not alone in believing the president-elect has gone out of his way to offend people. Probably they also recognize that, in the safe districts they all represent, an inaugural boycott might even be a political winner.But this is also part of a pattern. Lewis and Lee, along with some other Democratic lawmakers at the time, also boycotted to make a point when President George W. Bush was inaugurated in 2001. The Washington Post reported at the time that Lewis  thought it would be hypocritical to attend Bush s swearing-in because he doesn t believe Bush is the true elected president. Maybe they had a better excuse that time, as there was so much lingering acrimony surrounding the Florida recount. But we re talking about elected members of Congress who have refused to accept two Republican presidencies in a row. Is there always a good enough excuse whenever a Republican wins? At what point is it fair to ask whether some people are just not committed to democratic or legal processes at all unless the results come out as they hope?

 Trump Jr. Throws Temper Tantrum While Comey Testifies That His Dad Obstructed Justice,"Donald Trump has been asked by Republicans to not tweet during former FBI Director James Comey s testimony to Congress, so that task has apparently been given to his demon spawn instead.In his opening statement released on Wednesday, Comey shed light on a dinner he had with Trump in which Trump demanded Comey s loyalty. I need loyalty, I expect loyalty,  Trump said in January according to Comey.Comey then gave details of a meeting he had with Trump in February after the firing of Mike Flynn for having discussions with Russian officials.The President then returned to the topic of Mike Flynn, saying,  He is a good guy and has been through a lot.  He repeated that Flynn hadn t done anything wrong on his calls with the Russians, but had misled the Vice President. He then said,  I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go. It certainly sounds like Trump is guilty of trying to obstruct justice and that he fired Comey in order to sabotage the Russia investigation.As Comey testified in the Senate on Thursday, Donald Trump Jr. went on a tirade over it.1/3 Flynn stuff is BS in context 2 guys talking about a guy they both know well. I hear  I hope nothing happens but you have to do your job  Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) June 8, 20172/3 very far from any kind of coercion or influence and certainly not obstruction!

 Lifetime Republican Voter Thanks President Obama For Saving His Life With Obamacare,"Republican lawmakers hate Obamacare, but it s saving the lives of Republican voters.Even though Brent Brown hated the Affordable Care Act and refused to vote for President Obama in 2008 and 2012, the lifetime GOP voter from Wisconsin wrote a letter to the Democratic Commander-in-Chief apologizing for all the bad things he said and thanking Obama for saving his life.Brown thanked President Obama because the Affordable Care Act allowed him to finally access the medication he needs to  stabilize my condition. Prior to the passage of the landmark healthcare legislation, Brown had been denied health insurance because of a pre-existing condition. But because Obamacare requires insurance companies to cover people with pre-existing conditions, Brown was able to get the care he needed.So he wrote a heartfelt letter to President Obama in June, which the White House posted online, thanking him for saving his life and  for being my President.  Brown also admitted that he was wrong about the healthcare law.Here s the full letter via the White House.To My President,I sincerely hope that this reaches you, as far too often praise is hard to come by. Apologies to people who deserve it perhaps even less so.I did not vote for you. Either time. I have voted Republican for the entirety of my life. I proudly wore pins and planted banners displaying my Republican loyalty. I was very vocal in my opposition to you particularly the ACA.Before I briefly explain my story allow me to first say this: I am so very sorry. I understand written content cannot convey emotions very well but my level of conviction has me in tears as I write this. I was so very wrong. So very very wrong.You saved my life. I want that to sink into your ears and mind. My President, you saved my life, and I am eternally grateful.I have a  pre-existing condition  and so could never purchase health insurance. Only after the ACA came into being could I be covered. Put simply to not take up too much of your time if you are in fact taking the time to read this: I would not be alive without access to care I received due to your law. So thank you from a dumb young man who thought he knew it all and who said things about you that he now regrets. Thank you for serving me even when I didn t vote for you.Thank you for being my President.Honored to have lived under your leadership and guidance,Brent Nathan BrownIn a follow-up letter, Brown updated President Obama on how he is doing thanks to the Affordable Care Act.The Affordable Care Act saved my life. I can now say, after several surgeries, that I m in recovery from what was a serious autoimmune disease I was finally able to receive the quality of care that had eluded me for years. I was able to consult the top surgeon in my state for the particular surgery I needed. I was able to receive the stabilizing drug that was always hidden behind a doctor s apology:  I m sorry, Mr. Brown, we have to take your financial consideration into account.  I was able to stay at one of the best equipped hospitals in my state for as long as I needed, without having to worry about checking myself out early because of cost concerns. I had hope.If Republican lawmakers have their way, people like Brent Brown would lose this hope. They would be stripped of the newly found healthcare that they have waited years to finally receive. This letter is not only a testament to how Obamacare is helping millions of Americans, it s a warning to Republicans that they would be hurting their own voters by repealing the ACA.Brent Brown is a shining example of the Affordable Care Act s success and necessity, and he had the courage to say he was wrong and thank President Obama for fighting for him. It s too bad other Republicans refuse to do the same.Featured Image: Flickr"
HOW HILLARY CLINTON Has Secured Her Husband’s Legacy As “A Rapist” And Hers As An “Enabler” [VIDEO],"Hillary Clinton is a professional panderer. There is no vote she won t attempt to secure, no matter the cost. In reality, her desire to gain the vote of young women in America will only harm her, as her call to stop the sexual assaults against women on campuses across America only shines a light one of the ugliest aspects of the Clinton Crime Syndicate. Bill s pattern of sexual abuse, and Hillary s willingness to sit back and watch will undoubtedly to come back to haunt them. Anyone who thought Hillary could get away with this phony compassion for women who are truly sexual victims, underestimates the disdain that women on both sides of the aisle have for her and her serial rapist husband.Articles have now appeared in two left of center websites, VOX and Slate, noting that it s hard to dismiss Ms. (Anita) Broderick (claims of sexual assault by Bill Clinton) given the new progressive consensus on believing victims. Well the injunction to believe victims gained currency among progressives because of a potent mix of gender theory and advocacy statistics.The theory came from the legal scholar Catharine MacKinnon, who taught that: Feminism is built on believing women s accounts of sexual use and abuse and by men.  The statistics were supplied by activist researchers who claimed that women almost never lie about sexual assault. Now those activist statistics have been shredded, but among progressives, the doctrine of sexual victim infallibility, that lived on. But if victims are infallible, then those they accuse, must be presumed guilty. And that brings us to the Clintons. Hillary Clinton has signed on to that theory. Watch here: "
 Greta Van Susteren Slams Fox News For Not Dealing With Roger Ailes Sooner,"Fox News is collapsing like a house of cards as the fallout over rampant sexual harassment continues.Gretchen Carlson got the ball rolling when she filed a lawsuit against the conservative network, accusing Fox boss Roger Ailes of sexually harassing her and punishing her for refusing to have sex with him.Rather than stand by their colleague, however, Fox hosts such as Greta Van Susteren and others took Ailes  side instead.But now that Carlson has been vindicated and Ailes forced to resign, Van Susteren now regrets not believing the victim in the first place.In a post on Facebook on Friday, Van Susteren opened up about Carlson and expressed regret for not believing Carlson from the start. I read Geraldo s FB post in which he said he regretted not believing Gretchen Carlson s claim of sexual harassment,  she wrote.  We all regret it   I made my regret self evident in my GretaWire posting about 3 weeks ago which ended with this:  Gretchen, you go girl.  That said it all. Van Susteren continued by admitting that it was unfair for her to judge the case since she was 200 miles away from where the harassment took place and that she had never talked to Carlson about it to hear her side of the story personally. It is indeed true, when I read the complaint written by lawyers   I never spoke to Gretchen as she was long gone from Fox   I found it inconsistent with what was my experience and information at the Fox News Channel, admittedly working 200 miles from the  scene of the crimes.  It was hidden from all of us. Van Susteren left Fox News earlier this week and they replaced her with Brit Hume, a man who has spewed sexist remarks on the air for years.And now that she is no longer employed by Fox News, Van Susteren has absolutely no problem shaming her former employers for not doing anything about Roger Ailes sooner. But I have regrets beyond Geraldo s and beyond not believing a civil complaint written by lawyers. I regret that Roger Ailes was not supervised by those in a public corporation who had the duty to supervise him. This included his seniors, the CFO s of both Fox News Channel and 21CF (and its predecessor NewsCorp), the Board of Directors and what I assume this public corporation had, outside auditors. Checks written that were suspicious should have been spotted. But Fox News still hasn t learned much since many of the people who let Ailes get away with sexually harassing female employees, like Bill Shine, are still employed in their positions by the company.Even some high profile male hosts are still employed, including Steve Doocy, who was named in Carlson s lawsuit, and Bill O Reilly, who was named in Andrea Tantaros  lawsuit.Fox News needs to go beyond axing Ailes. They need to clean house or the working environment at Fox will simply continue being  like a sex-fueled, Playboy Mansion-like cult, steeped in intimidation, indecency and misogyny.

 Trump Angrily Goes After Hillary’s Competency With Misspelled Tweet,"On Thursday afternoon, Hillary Clinton delivered an impassioned speech regarding foreign policy and how dangerous Donald Trump would be not only to the nation, but to the world. She delivered it well and made point after point driving home the fact that Trump simply cannot be our next president.Not taking too kindly to the fact that Clinton was going after him, Trump quickly took to his medium of choice   Twitter.Trump wrote: Bad performance by Crooked Hillary Clinton! Reading poorly from the telepromter! She doesn t even look presidential! Bad performance by Crooked Hillary Clinton! Reading poorly from the telepromter! She doesn't even look presidential!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 2, 2016If only he knew how to spell teleprompter.And does Trump consider name-calling, explanation points and spelling incorrectly presidential? Apparently so.Oh, and yes, Trump did use a teleprompter for his foreign policy speech as well, and it was about as awkward as a 13-year-old boy asking the prettiest girl in school to the middle school spring fling.Truth be told, Trump doesn t even have the maturity level of a 13-year-old boy, probably more along the lines of a five- or six-year old. It s gotten to the point where you re waiting for him to tell people Hillary has cooties. Maybe he already has. Who s to know, really?Trump can go after Clinton all he wants on foreign policy, but the facts are the facts, and she absolutely wipes the floor with him in regards to experience. For example, he has none, and she s a former Secretary of State who is more traveled than any other Secretary of State in the history of the republic. She s brokered peace deals, for goodness sake.At the end of the day, it comes down to who can actually lead and get the job done, and Trump most certainly is not that person. No matter who the nominee is for the Democrats, they need to win in November.Featured Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images   Twitter"
Assange: ‘Crazed Clinton Campaign Tried to Hack WikiLeaks’,"SEE ALSO: ON THE QT:  US Election: Behind the Curtain  (PART 1)21st Century Wire says The Democratic Party and the Hillary Clinton campaign have chained themselves to the wild conspiracy theory that Russia is behind the embarrassing Wikileaks email dump and  the Kremlin is trying to interfere with the US election process    even though their is zero evidence to prove that ridiculous claim.Wikileaks has exposed what is arguably the biggest trove of political corruption in US history   but the majority pro-Hillary media are simply ignoring these leaks in order to get behind the media s pre-chosen candidate.So why is the Clinton political machine still panicking? Are we due for another October surprise ?RT Everyday that you publish is a day that you have the initiative in the conflict, Assange said via telephone at a conference in Argentina on Wednesday. The whistleblowing website has been releasing emails from Clinton s campaign chair, John Podesta, on a daily basis since early October.Assange claimed the release  whipped up a crazed hornet s nest atmosphere in the Hillary Clinton campaign  leading them to attack WikiLeaks. They attacked our servers and attempted hacking attacks and there is an amazing ongoing campaign where state documents were put in the UN and British courts to accuse me of being both a Russian spy and a pedophile,  he added.READ MORE: Suspicious US company tried to frame Assange as  pedophile  and Russian spyEcuador s decision to shut down his internet was described by Assange as a  strategic position  so that its  policy of non-intervention can t be misinterpreted by actors in the US and even domestically in Ecuador.

It cannot be a free and informed election unless people are free to inform. He also attacked US TV networks, many of whom he accused of being  controlled by Clinton supporters. ( ) The Podesta emails will make no difference to the election result, according to Assange.

"COMEDY GOLD! Bernie Sanders Has HILARIOUS Meltdown Over Repeal Of Obamacare: “If You Are Old..If You’re 55-60 Yrs Of Age And Don’t Have Health Insurance, You Will Die!” [VIDEO]","Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) could not say on Wednesday where he got the information that  thousands will die  if Obamacare is repealed.Sanders made the claim while speaking with CNN s Jake Tapper but could not provide any specific sources that backed his assertion, instead referring to  studies that have been done. You ve said if this repeal and replace plan goes forward that thousands of Americans will die,  Tapper said to Sanders.  Where do you get that estimate from? I get that estimate from the fact that studies have been done that people who do not have health insurance, who do not go to the doctor when they should, who do not go to the hospital when they need to go, in fact die,  Sanders said.  And thousands of people die every year because they don t have health insurance. And if you throw 24 million people off of health insurance, there is no doubt that many thousands of people will die. Jake Tapper then goes on to ask Bernie Sanders about the disastrous results of Obamacare, making insurance unaffordable for so many Americans. Tapper tells Sanders,  In many states Obamacare is in dire straights. The governor of Minnesota, a liberal Democrat said the  Affordable Care Act  is  unaffordable .  To his credit, Tapper continues with his line of questioning and actually shocks Sanders when he asks him,  Don t the Democrats own this bill that in so many states is failing? No, I think what the American, look, what you re saying is true,  Sanders replied.  No one, certainly not me, that the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, has many serious problems. Deductibles are too high, premiums are too high, we still have too many people who don t have any health insurance,  Sanders said.  It s too complicated, it s too bureaucratic.

WOW! New Email (Pictured) Uncovered Shows Hillary Telling Top Aide It’s A ‘Good Idea’ To Lie,"Who s Ready For Hillary?Among the thousands more Hillary Clinton s emails that have been released are ones exchanged with her top aide that may just add to the dilemma facing the 2016 Democratic Presidential candidate.Among the latest batch are emails from her adviser Sidney Blumenthal.On December 6, 2010 he sent her an email including a link to a news story with the headline:  U.S. Orders Diplomats to Stop Telling Truth Clinton replies:  Sounds like a good idea! The emails also reveal that Blumenthal felt the former Secretary of State was  vindicated  over the Libyan uprising even though the Benghazi scandal was still to come.Blumenthal told her in August 2011 she had to go on camera to announce the  successful strategy  when rebels took control of the country. He told her to speak to the media even if it meant giving a speech from the driveway of her holiday home in The Hamptons. Blumenthal wrote:  First, brava! This is a historic moment and you will be credited for realizing it.  When Qaddafi himself is finally removed, you should of course make a public statement before the cameras wherever you are, even in the driveway of your vacation house.  You must go on camera. You must establish yourself in the historical record at this moment. The most important phrase is:  successful strategy.  But in hindsight such vindication never materialized. In fact, Benghazi has become the second biggest headache for Hillary Clinton after Servergate. Over the following months after that email exchange, Libya slid into civil war and a year later US ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed when the American embassy in Benghazi was overrun by militants. The ensuing scandal has been an albatross for the candidate.Clinton was forced to testify before a House Committee investigating the terror attack that killed ambassador Stevens and could still be recalled to face more questions. Meanwhile, Libya has become what the State Department has called a  safe haven  for terrorists and a main launching point for people smugglers sending migrants to Europe. Via: Daily Mail "
 This Charity Decided To Use Trump’s Money To Fight Hate And Is Rubbing It In His Face,"The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) is so upset by Donald Trump s racist and bigoted presidential campaign they are redirecting past donations they have received from the reality TV star and real estate tycoon into programs designed to fight bigotry.The ADL made their announcement in a press release:The Anti-Defamation League has decided to redirect the total amount of funds contributed to ADL by Donald Trump and his foundation over the years   about $56,000 in all   to fund new anti-bias and anti-bullying education programs across America. In the past decade or so, Mr. Trump and his foundation have contributed a total of $56,000 to our organization. These undoubtedly were sincere gifts,  said Jonathan A. Greenblatt, ADL CEO.  But in light of the recent campaign, we have decided to redirect the total amount of funds that he contributed to ADL over the years specifically into anti-bias education programs that address exactly the kind of stereotyping and scapegoating that have been injected into this political season. The announcement was made in advance of Trump s planned speech to AIPAC, the pro-Israel American Israel Public Affairs Committee.ADL also  called on other groups, philanthropies and nonprofits to consider redirecting charitable funds given to them by Mr. Trump into similar initiatives to combat hate, promote tolerance, and build a stronger American community. Jonathan A. Greenblatt, CEO of ADL, specifically referenced Trump s rhetoric   especially his  penchant to slander minorities, slur refugees, dismiss First Amendment protections and cheer on violence. During the campaign, Trump has said he would look into measures to curtail the First Amendment rights of the media with regards to stories he felt were unfair towards him. He has called for protesters at his rally to be punched, knocked out and manhandled (his campaign manager was recently caught on video grabbing a protester by the collar).A centerpiece of Trump s campaign has been attacking undocumented immigrants, blaming them for rape and drugs. He has also called for a limit on Muslim travel to the United States.Featured image via Flickr"

"Collapsing: Why the ‘Russia Hack’ Witch Hunt Will Not End Well for Congress, or America","21st Century Wire says Washington s Russian witch hunt is now collapsing before our eyes. As host Patrick Henningsen revealed last Wednesday on ACR Radio, the supposedly damning information submitted by the FBI s private  cyber security  contractor Crowdstrike, of which the entire  Russian Hack  conspiracy theory hinges on   is fraudulent. Here is a link to their primary invented piece of  evidence  included in the US Intelligence Assessment. This means that we were correct back on Nov 1st when we said the Russian Hack story was a hoax designed distract from the explosive contents on the DNC and Podesta email leaks, and also to bolster a failing Hillary Clinton campaign by discrediting Donald Trump as being somehow in league with the evil Russians.If they keep pressing this story, it will only hurt the credibility of a Democratic Party that still refuses to admit the abject failures and corruption within of their political organization.Now the question remains: how more millions in US taxpayer money will Hollywood s Congressman Adam Schiff, and ringleaders Lindsey Graham waste before they re done trying to  look tough  on Russia and Trump? Will they be held accountable by anyone?In the end, we discover that Schiff, Feinstein, Graham, McCain and so many others in Washington have done extreme damage to American interests, and in the long run   to national security. Here s the story  US Congressman and NeoMcCarthyite Adam Schiff has himself become a ridiculous-looking caricature as of late. Justin Raimondo Antiwar.comThe allegation   now accepted as incontrovertible fact by the  mainstream  media   that the Russian intelligence services hacked the Democratic National Committee (and John Podesta s emails) in an effort to help Donald Trump get elected recently suffered a blow from which it may not recover.Crowdstrike is the cybersecurity company hired by the DNC to determine who hacked their accounts: it took them a single day to determine the identity of the culprits   it was, they said, two groups of hackers which they named  Fancy Bear  and  Cozy Bear,  affiliated respectively with the GRU, which is Russian military intelligence, and the FSB, the Russian security service.How did they know this?These alleged  hacker groups  are not associated with any known individuals in any way connected to Russian intelligence: instead, they are identified by the tools they use, the times they do their dirty work, the nature of the targets, and other characteristics based on the history of past intrusions.Yet as Jeffrey Carr and other cyberwarfare experts have pointed out, this methodology is fatally flawed.  It s important to know that the process of attributing an attack by a cybersecurity company has nothing to do with the scientific method,  writes Carr: Claims of attribution aren t testable or repeatable because the hypothesis is never proven right or wrong. Neither are claims of attribution admissible in any criminal case, so those who make the claim don t have to abide by any rules of evidence (i.e., hearsay, relevance, admissibility). Likening attribution claims of hacking incidents by cybersecurity companies to intelligence assessments, Carr notes that, unlike government agencies such the CIA, these companies are never held to account for their misses: When it comes to cybersecurity estimates of attribution, no one holds the company that makes the claim accountable because there s no way to prove whether the assignment of attribution is true or false unless (1) there is a criminal conviction, (2) the hacker is caught in the act, or (3) a government employee leaked the evidence. This lack of accountability may be changing, however, because Crowdstrike s case for attributing the hacking of the DNC to the Russians is falling apart at the seams like a cheap sweater.To begin with, Crowdstrike initially gauged its certainty as to the identity of the hackers with  medium confidence.  However, a later development, announced in late December and touted by the Washington Post, boosted this to  high confidence.  The reason for this newfound near-certainty was their discovery that  Fancy Bear  had also infected an application used by the Ukrainian military to target separatist artillery in the Ukrainian civil war. As the Post reported: While CrowdStrike, which was hired by the DNC to investigate the intrusions and whose findings are described in a new report, had always suspected that one of the two hacker groups that struck the DNC was the GRU, Russia s military intelligence agency, it had only medium confidence. Now, said CrowdStrike co-founder Dmitri Alperovitch,  we have high confidence  it was a unit of the GRU. CrowdStrike had dubbed that unit  Fancy Bear. Crowdstrike published an analysis that claimed a malware program supposedly unique to Fancy Bear, X-Agent, had infected a Ukrainian targeting application and, using GPS to geo-locate Ukrainian positions, had turned the application against the Ukrainians, resulting in huge losses: Between July and August 2014, Russian-backed forces launched some of the most-decisive attacks against Ukrainian forces, resulting in significant loss of life, weaponry and territory. Ukrainian artillery forces have lost over 50% of their weapons in the two years of conflict and over 80% of D-30 howitzers, the highest percentage of loss of any other artillery pieces in Ukraine s arsenal. Alperovitch told the PBS News Hour that  Ukraine s artillery men were targeted by the same hackers, that we call Fancy Bear, that targeted DNC, but this time they were targeting cell phones to try to understand their location so that the Russian artillery forces can actually target them in the open battle. It was the same variant of the same malicious code that we had seen at the DNC. He told NBC News that this proved the DNC hacker  wasn t a 400-pound guy in his bed,  as Trump had opined during the first presidential debate   it was the Russians.The only problem with this analysis is that is wasn t true. It turns out that Crowdstrike s estimate of Ukrainian losses was based on a blog post by a pro-Russian blogger eager to tout Ukrainian losses: the Ukrainians denied it. Furthermore, the hacking attribution was based on the hackers  use of a malware program called X-Agent, supposedly unique to Fancy Bear. Since the target was the Ukrainian military, Crowdstrike extrapolated from this that the hackers were working for the Russians.All somewhat plausible, except for two things: To begin with, as Jeffrey Carr pointed out in December, and now others are beginning to realize, X-Agent isn t unique to Fancy Bear. Citing the findings of ESET, another cybersecurity company, he wrote: Unlike Crowdstrike, ESET doesn t assign APT28/Fancy Bear/Sednit to a Russian Intelligence Service or anyone else for a very simple reason. Once malware is deployed, it is no longer under the control of the hacker who deployed it or the developer who created it. It can be reverse-engineered, copied, modified, shared and redeployed again and again by anyone. In other words     malware deployed is malware enjoyed! In fact, the source code for X-Agent, which was used in the DNC, Bundestag, and TV5Monde attacks, was obtained by ESET as part of their investigation! During our investigations, we were able to retrieve the complete Xagent source code for the Linux operating system . If ESET could do it, so can others. It is both foolish and baseless to claim, as Crowdstrike does, that X-Agent is used solely by the Russian government when the source code is there for anyone to find and use at will. Secondly, the estimate Crowdstrike used to verify the Ukrainian losses was supposedly based on data from the respected International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS). But now IISS is disavowing and debunking their claims: [T]he International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) told [Voice of America] that CrowdStrike erroneously used IISS data as proof of the intrusion. IISS disavowed any connection to the CrowdStrike report. Ukraine s Ministry of Defense also has claimed combat losses and hacking never happened . The CrowdStrike report uses our data, but the inferences and analysis drawn from that data belong solely to the report s authors,  the IISS said.  The inference they make that reductions in Ukrainian D-30 artillery holdings between 2013 and 2016 were primarily the result of combat losses is not a conclusion that we have ever suggested ourselves, nor one we believe to be accurate. One of the IISS researchers who produced the data said that while the think tank had dramatically lowered its estimates of Ukrainian artillery assets and howitzers in 2013, it did so as part of a  reassessment  and reallocation of units to airborne forces. No, we have never attributed this reduction to combat losses,  the IISS researcher said, explaining that most of the reallocation occurred prior to the two-year period that CrowdStrike cites in its report. The vast majority of the reduction actually occurs   before Crimea/Donbass,  he added, referring to the 2014 Russian invasion of Ukraine. The definitive  evidence  cited by Alperovitch is now effectively debunked: indeed, it was debunked by Carr late last year, but that was ignored in the media s rush to  prove  the Russians hacked the DNC in order to further Trump s presidential ambitions. The exposure by the Voice of America of Crowdstrike s falsification of Ukrainian battlefield losses   the supposedly solid  proof  of attributing the hack to the GRU   is the final nail in Crowdstrike s coffin Continue this story at Antiwar.comREAD MORE RUSSIAN HACK NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Russian Hack FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE    SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER@ 21WIRE.TV "
 Hillary Beautifully Slams Trump’s ‘Dangerous’ And Idiotic Gun Policies,"It s no doubt Hillary Clinton has made gun violence a cornerstone in this election. For the first time, the issue of gun violence and mass shootings are at the forefront of national presidential politics.So it should only make sense that the GOP s candidate and the NRA s newest puppet Donald Trump would try to hijack that attention and sweep it under the rug.After the NRA gleefully endorsed the presidential blowhard, Trump promised to eliminate gun free zones (while speaking at a gun free gathering) while slamming Hillary Clinton as  heartless  for wanting to  restrict  people s access to guns.Clinton didn t take to kindly to former (and brushed off the latter). Speaking at a conference organized by the Trayvon Martin Foundation, Clinton said:This is someone running to be president of the United States of America   a country facing a gun violence epidemic   and he s talking about more guns in our schools, he s talking about more hatred and division in our streets. That s no way to keep us safe.The conference, organized by Trayvon Martin s mother Sybrina Fulton, aimed to bring together mothers who lost children to gun violence. Over 200 individuals showed up for the conference, including Fulton and Queen Thompson Brown, whose son was killed in Miami. Queen, not budging to the sensationalized claims of gun grabbing, told reporters that their mission is not to take away guns, but to promote  common sense gun laws. Clinton continued:We have a moral obligation to protect our children no matter what zip code they live in. If you want to imagine what Trump s America will look like, picture more kids at risk of violence and bigotry, picture more anger and fear.Saying she would not be silenced or bullied, Clinton pledged to stand up to the gun lobby, specifically the NRA.So the American people are faced with two options: one that cow tows to the NRA (even though he supported a ban on assault weapons) and one that has never waivered in her support of victims of gun violence. We have one candidate that promises gun free zones while preaching in a gun free zone, and another that sits down with mothers and fathers who have lost their children.Featured image via Joe Readle/Getty Images"

HERE’S WHY OLE MISS Won’t Be Playing “DIXIE” Before Football Games This Year…There Goes Another SOUTHERN Tradition…,"INCLUSIVENESS! That is the reason given in the statement by he Ole Miss Athletic Department another SOUTHERN TRADITION bites the dust! At what point do SOUTHERNERS say,  ENOUGH!  The traditions of the Southern colleges like Ole Miss are being stopped for fear of hurting people s feelings for not being included? THIS IS THE SOUTH and THIS is the reason so many people from everywhere choose to go to one of the Southern Colleges! These colleges are FULL of tradition. Would we go to any other part of America and demand that they stop a tradition like singing  Dixie ? This is ridiculous! SO WHY ARE THEY STILL CALLED THE  REBELS ? Ole Miss  band will no longer play  Dixie  before football games.Ole Miss Athletics Department issued a statement saying it was time for the university to create new traditions.Dixie a song that was the unofficial anthem of the Confederate States of America during the Civil War has been a staple of Pride of the South s lineup for nearly seven decades. Recently the band stopped playing the song during games, but had continued to perform it in The Grove on game days.The athletic department released the following statement about the change: The newly expanded and renovated Vaught-Hemingway Stadium will further highlight our best traditions and create new ones that give the Ole Miss Rebels the best home field advantage in college football. Because the Pride of the South is such a large part of our overall experience and tradition, the Athletics Department asked them to create a new and modern pregame show that does not include Dixie and is more inclusive for all fans.

 Donald Trump Just Changed His Twitter Header And The Whole Internet Is Making Fun Of Him (TWEETS),"Donald Trump spent Monday pretty much just making an ass of himself on Twitter. After he attempted to intimidate Sally Yates and tweeted numerous lies about the hearing later in the day, one might assume The Donald would take a break. Instead, he took one of those aforementioned lies and blasted it across the top of his Twitter profile.The header, as you can see, features the whitest room of people you have ever seen all giving a thumbs up and   because he s a narcissist   one of his own quotes, which is a lie: Director Clapper reiterated what everybody, including the fake media already knows- there is  no evidence  of collusion w/ Russia and Trump. Naturally, Twitter is having a lot of fun with this:Never really believed there was collusion between Trump & Russia.. until he just put that twitter header up.

Clapper explained that he was not aware of any evidence demonstrating collusion, but that he was unaware of the FBI investigation into the administration s dealings with Russia until Director James Comey announced its existence publicly in March. That s a far cry from  no evidence. The real story   the one Trump doesn t want you to know   is that Sally Yates confirmed under oath that she warned Donald Trump General Mike Flynn was compromised 18 days before Trump did anything about it. We believed that Gen. Flynn was compromised with respect to the Russian,  Yates said.  To state the obvious, you don t want your national security adviser compromised with the Russians.

LEADING N. CAROLINA NEWSPAPER: Girls Need To Attempt “Overcoming Discomfort” At Sight Of “Male Genitalia” In Locker Rooms,"The Leftist agenda in action blurring the lines of sexuality, while stripping humanity of any sense of individuality or morality A leading North Carolina newspaper issued an editorial last week telling girls to attempt  overcoming discomfort  at the sight of  male genitalia,  should transgender bathroom laws be enacted.In a defense of President Obama s order compelling schools to allow access to restrooms on the basis of gender identity, the Charlotte Observer editorial board compared the discomfort of school-aged girls seeing male genitalia in locker rooms to the discomfort of white people being around black people in post-segregation America. This is what the Obama administration nudged the rest of the country toward Friday,  the editorial said.  Yes, the thought of male genitalia in girls  locker rooms   and vice versa   might be distressing to some. But the battle for equality has always been in part about overcoming discomfort   with blacks sharing facilities, with gays sharing marriage   then realizing it was not nearly so awful as some people imagined. While admitting that exposure to male genitalia is a possible outcome of transgender bathroom laws, the editorial said the notion that such laws constitute a threat to the privacy and safety of women and children is a  political fiction  pushed by Republicans. Those safety issues are political fiction   non-transgender men wouldn t have been allowed in women s bathrooms under the Charlotte ordinance that HB 2 killed, and the 200 or so cities with similar ordinances have had no incidents involving bathroom predators,  the editorial said.

 Trump Supporters Already Regret Voting For Him And Here’s The Hilarious Proof,"Let s all point and laugh at the SAD Trump supporters who are just now realizing that they got totally conned.Donald Trump made a lot of promises on the campaign trail but ever since Election night he has backed away from many of them or broken them entirely.First, Trump didn t  drain the swamp.  His cabinet is set to be the wealthiest in history and most of his picks are Washington insiders and elites that conservatives loathe.And many conservatives now realize that Trump is going to help Republicans wipe out Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, programs Trump repeatedly swore to leave intact.Trump will also not prosecute Hillary Clinton and the  big beautiful wall  he promised to build along the Mexican border is apparently going to be more like a lame fence instead.So, many of Trump s supporters are regretting the choice they made on Election Day and are expressing that regret on social media. And luckily for us, a Tumblr site known as Trumpgrets is collecting all of their right-wing tears for our viewing entertainment.And there are plenty more where those came from.Voting for Donald Trump is the biggest regret that 62,686,062 Americans will have to live with for the rest of their lives. They will be forever known and mocked as the dumbasses who irrevocably damaged this country with their sheer stupidity. But Trump voters are far from the only people who should and do have regrets. Millions more simply stayed at home or voted for a third party that had no chance of actually winning. And now America is paying the price for it.The truly sad thing is that Trump hasn t even taken office yet, so we can only imagine how much more people will regret their choice as these next four years drag on.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images"
LIBERAL DUMMY GARY JOHNSON Can’t Name One Foreign Leader [VIDEO],"Maybe comedy is a better career choice for Gary Gary Johnson, the Libertarian nominee for president, had been raring for Wednesday night s  town hall  on MSNBC. He had been cut from the first televised debate after missing the polling threshold, and he had not been invited when the network hosted a  commander-in-chief forum  with Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. This was their consolation prize,  Johnson told The Washington Post this week when asked about the MSNBC special.  It was put to us that, look, you weren t in this initial program. Here s what we d like to offer in lieu of being with the two major-party candidates. And I said,  An hour of prime time Chris Matthews? I ll take it.   But the hour didn t go as planned. Johnson, who had been pilloried for blanking on the relevance of the Syrian city of Aleppo in another MSNBC interview, whiffed his way through an even easier foreign policy question. Who s your favorite foreign leader?  Matthews asked. Who s my favorite?  Johnson replied. Anywhere in the continents,  Matthews said.  Any country. Name one foreign leader that you look up to. William Weld, Johnson s running mate, chimed in with an assist:  I m with Shimon Peres. I m talking about living, okay?  Matthews said.  You gotta do this. Any continent. Canada, Mexico? I guess I m having an Aleppo moment,  Johnson said. In the whole world!  Matthews said.  Anybody in the world. I know, I know,  Johnson said. Pick any leader,  Matthews said. The former president of Mexico,  Johnson said. Which one?  Matthews said. I m having a brain freeze,  Johnson said.Weld, who had left the governor s office in Massachusetts in an unsuccessful attempt to become ambassador to Mexico, began naming the country s former presidents.  Fox? Zedillo? Calderon? Fox,  Johnson said with a combination of jubilation and relief.  He was terrific. "
CHARLES BARKLEY Says Anyone Who Criticizes Obama Is A Racist…Gay Rights More Important Than Religious Freedom In America [VIDEO],"On March 20, 2016 Barkley had this to say about Obama:  Listen, you people in America who are upset that President Obama did a [March Madness NCAA Basketball] bracket   why don t ya ll just go say you don t like him because he s black. He continued,  Cut through all the BS   don t say he take too many vacations   just say,  We don t like him because he s black.'  Via: TMZLess than a month ago, Charles Barkley said anyone who disagrees with Obama does so because they are discriminating against him because he is black. And now, according to the all-knowing former NBA star, anyone who believes the religious rights of business owners should be protected is discriminating against gays. What about white Christians Charles? Are they entitled to any protections, or do you have to fall into some sort of minority category in order to have any rights or protections in the new progressive America? Charles Barkley wants to move All-Star game due to 'Anti-LGBT' lawhttps://t.co/P0hK7FpJFo  FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) April 8, 2016Retired professional basketball player and NBA analyst Charles Barkley has been bringing politics into this year s March Madness tournament left and right.His latest comments center around Indiana s Religious Freedom Act, the left s latest punching bag. Discrimination in any form is unacceptable to me,  Barkley said Friday in a statement released through his agent to USA Today.  As long as anti-gay legislation exists in any state, I strongly believe big events such as the Final Four and Super Bowl should not be held in those states  cities. The Religous Freedom Act prevents Indiana state and local governments from  substantially burdening a person s ability to exercise their religion   unless the government can show that it has a compelling interest and that the action is the least-restrictive means of achieving it,  according to the Indianapolis Star.The legislation, which will take effect July 1, makes no specific mention of sexual orientation, but it was quickly dubbed  anti-gay  by opponents.Barkley also turned the popular basketball tournament political when he made comments about President Obama s March Madness bracket. He said that people were criticizing Obama for filling out a bracket because  he s black.  Via: Red Alert Politics "
 Alabama Supreme Court SHOCKS Conservatives With This Latest Ruling,"Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore is so pissed right now.Ever since the U.S. Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage in their Obergefell v. Hodges ruling last summer, Alabama has resisted following it.Almost immediately, Moore ordered county clerks and judges to refuse to help same-sex couples get married, claiming that the nation s high court has no power to overturn a state ban on same-sex marriage.Despite Moore s efforts to keep defying the Supreme Court, his colleagues on the state bench made the opposite decision on Friday.In a single sentence, the Alabama Supreme Court chose to not defy the high court by rejecting an anti-same-sex marriage case brought by the Alabama Citizens Action Program and the Alabama Policy Institute. It is ordered that all pending motions and petitions are dismissed,  the majority of the court ruled, thus ending the fight against federal authorities that Moore wanted so badly.According to the Associated Press,In one of several written opinions accompanying the order, Justice Greg Shaw called the decision a  clear refusal  to ignore the Supreme Court ruling last June.Several other state justices railed against the high court s ruling while noting they can t overturn it.Chief Justice Roy Moore wrote that previous state orders barring gay marriage in Alabama remain. Most probate judges already are ignoring that directive, however, and hundreds of same-sex couples already have wed in Alabama.NBC News had more about what Moore wrote in his dissenting opinion.Quoting everything from past court rulings to the Bible and the 1974 song  Feelings,  the chief justice called the court s ruling  immoral, unconstitutional and tyrannical.  He referred to homosexuality as a  disgrace to human nature  which can t be compared to opposite-sex intimacy. Sodomy has never been and never will be an act by which a marriage can be consummated,  Moore wrote.This is a victory for the LGBT community and a victory for sanity in general. Even Moore s fellow judges acknowledged that the U.S. Supreme Court has the final say and federal law trumps state law no matter how they may feel about same-sex marriage personally.It s definitely a significant setback for conservative  Christians  in the state who were hoping to keep bigotry, hate, and their ability to discriminate at will enshrined under state law.Featured image via Flickr"
WATCH: BLACK ACTRESS Stacey Dash Destroy Argument By Hollywood Race Agitator And Wife Of Will Smith: “Either we want to have segregation or integration”,"Stacey Dash is no stranger to controversy. She was recently suspended by FOX News when she said that [Barack]  Obama doesn t give a shit about terrorism. Today, on Fox and Friends, Stacey takes on Hollywood race hustler, and major Louis Farrakahn donor Jada Pinkett-Smith.Fox News contributor Stacey Dash asserted on Wednesday that Jada Pinkett Smith was a  hypocrite  for expecting some black actors to be nominated for an Oscar while the black community was enjoying special privileges like Black History Month and the BET channel.Watch Dash s appearance on Fox and Friends here:In a video posted to Facebook earlier this week, Smith revealed that she would not be attending the 88th Academy Awards to protest the fact all of the major nominees were white.(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3"";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));We must stand in our power.Posted by Jada Pinkett Smith on Monday, January 18, 2016After recently being suspended from Fox News for saying President Barack Obama did not  give a sh*t,  she was back on the network on Wednesday to respond to Smith. I think it s ludicrous,  she opined.  Because we have to make up our minds. Either we want to have segregation or integration. If we don t want segregation then we need to get rid of channels like BET and the BET Awards and the [NAACP] Image Awards, where you are only awarded if you are black. So you say there should not be a BET channel?  Fox News host Steve Doocy wondered. No, just like there shouldn t be a Black History Month,  Dash replied.  You know, we re Americans. Period. That s it. Are you saying there shouldn t be a Black History Month because there isn t a White History Month?  Doocy pressed. Exactly!  Dash insisted.According to Dash, the real problem was that Hollywood s support of President Barack Obama had not inspired filmmakers to create more black roles. We ve had a president who is black in office for the past eight years, who gets most of his funding from the liberal elite in Hollywood,  she said.  Yet, there are not very many roles for people of color. How can that be and why is it just now being addressed?  Via: RAW Story "
" ‘Tehran’ Tom Cotton Insults U.S. Troops, Tries To Spark War With Iran In Disgraceful Interview (VIDEO)","Nobody has spent more of his political career trying to undermine his own government than Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AK). The Tea Party Republican most known for his borderline treasonous letter he sent to Iran in a shameful attempt to derail sensitive nuclear negotiations between President Obama and Iran s government. His ravings failed to accomplish anything and in recent months he s been relegated to the obscurity he deserves. Until now.On the night of the State of the Union, Cotton went on CNN s  Situation Room  to openly and egregiously spread lies about President Obama, even while a difficult situation was unfolding in Iran. On Tuesday evening, the Navy announced that two of its ships, and 10 U.S. sailors, were being held by the Iranian government after the boats floated into the country s territory.Conservatives rapidly lost their minds, even while details continued to come in suggesting the international incident was minor and, in all likelihood, harmless.The Americans were on a training mission in the Persian Gulf when the riverine boats experienced  a navigational or mechanical difficulty  and appear to have drifted into Iranian waters, according to the Pentagon. Iranian Coast Guard boats brought the vessels to a Revolutionary Guard base on Farsi Island, officials said.U.S. officials said they believe that craft steered off course and that the crew was aided, not captured, by Iranian forces. There doesn t seem to be anything malicious at work on either side,  according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the internal assessment.Iran said it was working on releasing the crew members  promptly. No big deal, right? In fact, the very lack of hostilities supports the idea that the tensions between the United States and Iran is cooling off, thanks to President Obama s commitment to negotiations.Not as Sen. Cotton tells it. Speaking straight into the camera, Cotton spews lie after lie. His only agenda, to hurt the president s reputation and provoke a hostile response from Iran.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3j8cFq6vUU]In labeling the ships  captured  and the crew held  hostage,  Cotton is viciously lying about the troops. They weren t taken by force. They aren t gagged and bound somewhere in enemy territory. Their boat experienced difficulties and they were rescued by Iranian ships. They never surrendered. The United States was never asked to  apologize  to the Iranians.But by fear-mongering to score political points, Cotton does risk inflaming tensions. Not that the lives of these men and women register in the deep, dark cavity where Cotton s brain allegedly lives. It s clear that even waiting until the sailors are safely out of Iran is too much to ask for a Republican who is hell-bent on painting the Middle Eastern country as a dangerous enemy.As usual, American soldiers are being used by a Republican to serve his agenda. Secretary of State John Kerry couldn t do an interview with CNN, even if it might have helped Democrats in the polls, he was too busy talking personally with Iranian officials, coordinating the release of these soldiers.So going into tonight s State of the Union, where rhetoric on both sides will be high, ask yourself this: Which politician  supports  the troops more? The one who uses them as bargaining chips to lie his way into better poll numbers or the one who spent the last few hours making sure they get home safely.Feature image via YouTube"
HARVARD BULLIED INTO Dropping 80 Year Old “Racist” Law School Emblem,"Harvard is agreeing to erase the history of their Law School founder to satisfy individuals or groups who don t agree with him. Didn t we see something similar to this happening in the Middle East? It wasn t that long ago that ISIS destroyed all symbols of Christianity in Iraq and other countries because they represented the history of Christ and was offensive to the Islamic terrorists. Did Americans think that was okay? This politically incorrect nonsense needs to stop before every ounce of history has been sanitized from our public and private schools, colleges and universities Harvard University has decided to drop its famous law school emblem after a handful of students said it was racist because it was tied to an 18th-century family of slave holders.The Harvard Corporation, the body that governs the university, voted in favor of a Harvard Law School committee recommendation to drop the seal. Harvard s president, Drew Faust, told the dean of the law school, Martha Minow, he approved the idea, Reuters reported.The emblem has been around since 1936. It shows three sheaves of wheat with the motto,  Veritas,  the Latin word for truth, scrolled across the top.The image comes from the coat of arms used by the family of Isaac Royall, a man the media paints as the son of an Antiguan slaveholder   who was also the endower of the first law professorship at the university, Reuters said. Via: WNDThe university denied it was revising history.Maybe they were just caving to threats or threatening behavior like this protest that took place on campus.

Several portraits were discovered Thursday with black strips of tape placed diagonally over the black faculty members  faces. The portraits were on the first floor of Wasserstein Hall, which houses two hallways with more than 180 framed portraits of law professors.Harvard Law School Dean Michele Minow said in a statement  The Harvard University Police Department is investigating the incident as a hate crime. Harvard Law School students started a Facebook page with the following stated mission: We are a movement of students calling for the decolonization of our campus, the symbols, the curriculum and the history of Harvard Law SchoolHere is a post from that page: While we accept the request to change the shield, we do so on the understanding that the school will actively explore other steps to recognize rather than to suppress the realities of its history, mindful of our shared obligation to honor the past not be seeking to erase it, but rather by bringing it to light and learning from it,  Faust said, Reuters reported.

What is it about women in the Democrat Party (Hillary) who don t really mean what they say?The Democratic National Committee has released a statement about the shooting of 11 police officers in Dallas tonight. The shooting took place at a Black Lives Matter protest against the deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile at the hands of police this week. In a press conference, the chief of the police department clearly said that there is no known link between the snipers and the protesters.Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Shultz didn t get that memo. The statement from the DNC looks like this:Pay attention to that penultimate paragraph. The last line, in particular, is noteworthy. And while most protesters have made their voices heard peacefully, tonight s shooting of officers in Dallas is unacceptable and a reminder that the time to address these tensions and find common ground is long overdue. What are you implying here, DWS?Image via: TwitterVia: Mediate"
 Donald Trump Storms Glenn Beck’s Ted Cruz Rally Live On-Air And Shuts It Down (VIDEO/TWEETS),"Awkward does not even come close to describing how cringeworthy and weird things got in Nevada on Tuesday night. As Glenn Beck was merrily rallying Republicans in the name of Ted Cruz, competitor Donald Trump gatecrashed the event and proceeded to give an impromptu speech to the assembled audience. Seemingly unwilling to be outmaneuvered by the Cruz camp as Ben Carson was in Iowa, Trump decided to take his war to the Ted Cruz camp in person. First, the hate-tweets   there was a Twitter tirade in the run-up to the event.Ted Cruz only talks tough on immigration now because he did so badly in S.C. He is in favor of amnesty and weak on illegal immigration.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 23, 2016Wow was Ted Cruz disloyal to his very capable director of communication. He used him as a scape goat-fired like a dog! Ted panicked.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 23, 2016Ted Cruz does not have the right ""temperment"" to be President. Look at the way he totally panicked in firing his director of comm. BAD!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 23, 2016Ted Cruz lifts the Bible high into the air and then lies like a dog-over and over again! The Evangelicals in S.C. figured him out & said no!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 23, 2016Then, came the in-person assault.Conservative pundit Beck was literally on stage, making his case to vote Cruz before a large crowd, when Trump stormed the hall. Trump, flanked by security, was immediately mobbed by the GOP fans in the room. He then picked up a microphone and began his own impromptu speech, cutting Beck dead.The crowd seemed all-too-happy to have their Cruz-fest interrupted by the GOP favorite, gathering tightly around the candidate and cheering in response to his weird and creepy speech.MSNBC happened to be broadcasting live at the Palo Verde High School in Summerlin, and was able to capture the bizarre scenes in full.Beck stood in silence on the stage, looking on helplessly as his event was overtaken by Trump, who told crowds: We are going to have hopefully a historic night, I appreciate everybody being here. I wanted to be here myself and say a few words. Get over there and vote! Make America great again! Trump went on to win Nevada by a landslide, with Marco Rubio narrowly pushing Ted Cruz into third place.He won a massive 45.9% of the vote, knocking Marco Rubio into 2nd place with just 23.9%, and Cruz in 3rd on 21.4%. It appears that the Trump campaign is unassailable at this point, although a week is a long time in U.S. politics.Awkward.Featured image via Screengrab"
"REAL INDIAN, GOP Senate Hopeful Shiva Ayyadurai Just Got Great News…FAKE INDIAN Elizabeth Warren Aligns Herself With Hillary Clinton In New Fundraising Email","Mass Live  Ayyadurai, who announced his Republican U.S. Senate bid in February, said that while he may not be the GOP establishment s candidate, his track record of overcoming barriers and fighting big institutions makes him the best person to take on the high-powered incumbent. I know that Warren   in spite of (what) people think she is   is extremely weak,  he said in an interview.  She s a formidable enemy, but weak in the sense that where she s fundamentally coming from, her basis of where she s coming from, has massive weakness and I know how to expose that weakness. Ayyadurai, 53, moved to the U.S. from India as a child. He compared the Democratic senator and former Harvard University professor to those at the top of India s caste system   a social structure in which he said his family held a low position. If you look at what we have today, we have a neo-caste system and at the top of that heap is people like Warren,  he said.  They are the academics, career politicians and lawyer/lobbyists. And that clan   is extremely spineless, they never expect to be challenged. And I ve challenged them. Last month, Ayyadurai made news when he sent Democrat Senator Elizabeth Warren a DNA kit for her birthday (which she rejected) after Warren was caught lying about being a Native American on a application for a teaching position at Harvard University, allegedly hoping that her fake minority status would place her ahead of other applicants for the job.Senator Elizabeth Warren is not only a liar, she s also not very bright. Warren sent out an email today that was clearly designed to appeal to women. In the email, Warren names the very unpopular Hillary Clinton, not only once, but twice. Warren starts out the email by mentioning Hillary s name in the first sentence:Hillary Clinton said that  it takes a village,  and she was right.  None of us can raise a family, build a business, heal a community, or lift a country totally alone. Warren used Hillary s name again near the end of her email:Every minute counts to get a campaign off the ground. It mattered the most when the DSCC helped launch my Senate campaign, and when they were there for Hillary when she launched her Senate career 17 years ago.Apparently, Warren missed the dreadful polls showing how the wildly unpopular Hillary Clinton s like ability continues to plummet, even after the race.If Warren stays the course and continues to align herself with Crooked Hillary, the very successful entrepreneur and President Trump supporter Shiva Ayyadurai will no doubt be able to use her embarrassingly bad decision to his advantage.Mass Live- If elected, Ayyadurai said he hopes to bring a sense of innovation to the Senate when it comes to addressing hot-button issues, as well as to look at problems from an engineering and science perspective.Casting himself as a  Lincoln Republican,  the entrepreneur said his campaign platform will largely focus on three areas: immigration, education and innovation.As an immigrant, Ayyadurai said he believes it is important that the U.S. secure its borders, root out so-called sanctuary cities and ensure people enter the country legally.He added that he also supports ensuring parents and students have choices when it comes to public education, and argued that more must be done to address what he called  pay-to-play  academic science research.Ayyadurai, who holds four degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is the founder and chairman of CytoSolve, a startup that has developed a  computational platform for scalable integration of molecular pathway models  used in drug development.He is one of three Republicans who have filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to run for the Massachusetts Senate seat in 2018.To donate to Shiva Ayyadurai s senate campaign, click HERE.Here is Warren s email:Friend  Hillary Clinton said that  it takes a village,  and she was right.  None of us can raise a family, build a business, heal a community, or lift a country totally alone. I ve seen what a village, a community, and a movement can do, one action at a time. And I ve seen how women can help women   especially when we run for office.I sure remember what it was like running for the Senate as a first-time candidate in 2011. I had to learn everything it took to raise money, build a grassroots organizing operation, and stand up to a Republican incumbent with $10 million in the bank   and I had to do it fast.And here s what I know: I absolutely, positively couldn t have done it on my own.So when the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee told me they wanted a strong launch of the Women s Senate Network for the 2018 cycle, to help women run and make sure more voices like mine and Hillary s are in the Senate, I immediately told them:I m all in.Today, I m asking you to join me in becoming a 2018 founding member of the DSCC Women s Senate Network. Because you were there for Hillary, I m hoping you ll add your name to help us build a community to support women who run for office.Now let me be blunt: 2018 is going to be a hard year for Democrats. We ve got 10 women who are up for reelection to the Senate, including me   more than ever before in history. And many are in some really tough races.That s why the DSCC s Women s Senate Network is ramping up its 2018 efforts early to elect and protect smart, tough, and experienced candidates to fight for what s right   senators who understand that being a woman is not a pre-existing condition, that we deserve equal pay for equal work, and that we sure as heck need Planned Parenthood and affordable health care for hardworking families.Let s continue our fight and get more women in leadership in this country.I m counting on you to keep fighting for what we all started: become a 2018 founding member of the DSCC Women s Senate Network today. You ll even get your very own  Nevertheless, She Persisted  sticker when you do!Every minute counts to get a campaign off the ground. It mattered the most when the DSCC helped launch my Senate campaign, and when they were there for Hillary when she launched her Senate career 17 years ago.And with your help, we can be there for the women who need help defending their seats now and for the next generation of women candidates ready to move into leadership. Early help makes all the difference.Thank you for owning a piece of this.Elizabeth "
 Dem Senator ‘Increasingly Concerned’ Trump Will Fire Mueller And Rosenstein To Stop Russia Probe,"Donald Trump is desperate to stop the investigation into his dirty Russian escapades and even went as far as firing FBI Director James Comey, who just happened to be investigating him. Now, Sen. Dianne Feinstein says she is growing  increasingly concerned  that Trump might try to fire both Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is overseeing the probe into Trump s possible collusion with Russia and his obstruction of justice, and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.Feinstein, who is the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, laid out her concerns in a statement on Friday. The message the president is sending through his tweets is that he believes the rule of law doesn t apply to him and that anyone who thinks otherwise will be fired. That s undemocratic on its face and a blatant violation of the president s oath of office,  she wrote.Citing Trump s most recent tweets regarding the Russia investigation, which he has repeatedly called a  witch hunt,  Feinstein said Trump has  embarked on an effort to undermine anyone with the ability to bring any misdeeds to light. The Senate should not let that happen. We re a nation of laws that apply equally to everyone, a lesson the president would be wise to learn,  Feinstein said.Trump doesn t have the authority to fire Mueller. However, he can order Rosenstein to fire him. When Rosenstein testified before Congress, he said that he would only consider firing Mueller if there was  good cause.  But if Trump wanted to, he is able to fire Rosenstein and appoint someone who, after Senate confirmation, would follow his orders blindly.But Feinstein warned that this would be a huge mistake on Trump s part and would inevitably lead to a revolt of  even his staunchest supporters. If the president thinks he can fire Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein and replace him with someone who will shut down the investigation, he s in for a rude awakening. Even his staunchest supporters will balk at such a blatant effort to subvert the law,  she said.The similarities between Trump and Nixon just keep piling up. If he were to go the route Feinstein fears, it would be the Saturday Night Massacre all over again and would probably lead to the same outcome: impeachment.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images"
"Ammon and Ryan Bundy Found ‘Not Guilty’ in Oregon Federal Case, Gov. Kate Brown Upset by Jury Decision","21st Century Wire Yesterday, Judge Anna Brown handed out  not guilty  verdicts to both Ammon and Ryan Bundy, leaders of the 41 day occupation of Malheur National Wildlife refuge near Burns, Oregon earlier this year.  The Bundys along with five other defendants, were acquitted of all major charges relating to the Oregon protest event, including  conspiring to impede refuge employees  and possession of firearms at a federal facility. Ammon Bundy led the protest in Oregon in January 2016.Ammon and Ryan Bundy are still being held in custody however, awaiting a second trial will they will face federal charges in the state of Nevada over the high-profile Bundy Ranch Standoff with the employees of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) near Bunkerville in April 2014.The Burns standoff came to an abrupt end after one protest spokesman and Arizona resident, Robert LaVoy Finicum (photo, left), died after police fired on protester vehicles, before a special federal tactical team tracked, shot and killed the rancher at a pre-planned ambush along a remote rural road outside of Burns.Not surprisingly, the surprise acquittal has sent Democratic Party-linked media outlets into a tail spin. The New York Times still labelled the the Bundy brothers as  Armed antigovernment protesters  indicating a hyperbolic editorial bias against the defendants which was visible through the trajectory of this story.Similarly, both Oregon Gov. Kate Brown and Harney County Sheriff David Ward are on record saying that were not happy with Friday s verdict, not surprisingly, as both these officials played a crucial role in the state s escalation of violence which colminated in Finicum s death. Brown even issued a public statement saying she was disappointed  the jury s decision.Despite a campaign of highly coordinated  trial by media  propaganda, led by the Oregonian Newspaper and other federal-leaning media outlets like the Washington Post, and ultra-liberal websites like Salon.com the jury was still able to judge the facts, and eventually ruled on the side of the protesters. I knew that what my husband was doing was right, but I was nervous because the judge was controlling the narrative,  said Angela Bundy, 39, wife of Ryan to a Times reporter.According to one juror, the verdict was a statement regarding the various failures of the prosecution  to prove that there was a conspiracy   indicating that the federal government s botched affair might have been down to over-zealous political atmosphere in Washington that led to proscecutors going for a completely over-the-top set of charges in order to make a political statment   instead of just sticking to the facts and Constiutional law.Police Tase Bundy Lawyer in CourtroomRight after the verdict was rendered, a bizarre courtroom scene erupted which ended in one of the Bundy s defense lawyers was tased and taken into custody after he asked the court to produce paperwork showing the order to rearrest  his client. Attorney Marcus Mumford was visibly shaken after the incident.Watch the video testimony of Mumford here: READ MORE OREGON STANDOFF NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Oregon Files"
49 Year Old “Political Refugee” Flies To Dubai Days Before Trial For RAPE Of Grade School Girl In Washington,"How does a refugee who is facing trial for the rape of a school aged girl board a plane in America and fly overseas to another country? The little girl who was allegedly raped by this man probably wishes she had a plane she could ve boarded to get away from him. A 49-year-old man reportedly boarded a flight for the United Arab Emirates two days before he was to stand trial in Kennewick on charges of raping and molesting a grade-school girl.A nationwide arrest warrant was issued this week for Khalid A. Fathey after he was a no-show at his Benton County Superior Court trial.The U.S. Marshals Service then discovered that Fathey left Seattle on July 23 on a plane bound for Dubai, said Deputy Prosecutor Anita Petra.Fathey was free on his personal recognizance since being charged with the sex crimes in May 2015. He now faces a new charge of bail jumping.Judge Vic VanderSchoor waited 1 1/2 hours Monday   in case Fathey had car trouble or another problem   before calling off the trial, releasing the jurors and ordering the arrest warrant.Kennewick attorney Kevin Holt, who was hired by Fathey, said he met with his client for about eight hours on July 21 and then prepared for the trial. He assured me that he would be here Monday morning,  Holt said.Holt said his client is from northern Iraq. Fathey had been in the military and worked with the United States government after the 2003 invasion, he said.Since Fathey was no longer welcome in Iraq under the new regime, he sought political asylum and came to the United States with his wife and children as political refugees, Holt said.Fathey and his wife were paid by the state for four years to be full-time caregivers for a Tri-City woman who had medical issues, he said.Fathey contends the sex crimes did not happen and were made up by the girl s family. Fathey and his family had to move to Spokane from Kennewick about six months ago because they were afraid for their safety in the Tri-Cities, especially after someone reportedly set fire to their car, said Holt.Prosecutors allege the girl s mother became suspicious in December 2014 when she found the girl and Fathey together, and Fathey  appeared nervous. The girl later disclosed to her mother that Fathey allegedly kissed her and touched her sexually several times over a six-month period. Fathey  told (the girl) never to tell or she was going to get in trouble,  documents said.Before the police were involved, Fathey called his religious leader, who had them sit down together with the girl s parents, court documents said. Fathey admitted to the inappropriate touching but would not elaborate, documents said.The girl s mother fainted during the meeting, and police were called.Fathey is charged with one count of first-degree rape of a child and two counts of first-degree child molestation. All three counts include the aggravating circumstance that he used a position of trust to commit the crimes.Read more here: Tri-City Herald"
 NYPD So Delighted With Cop Who Killed Eric Garner They Now Pay Him $120K,"Daniel Pantaleo was caught on video using an illegal chokehold on Eric Garner, killing him in front of the entire world for the crime of selling loose cigarettes. There was a lengthy investigation, but ultimately no indictment, despite public outrage and widespread protests. Now, a new report of payroll records shows just how delighted the NYPD was with Pantaleo and his deadly actions.Ever since Pantaleo killed Garner on that New York City street, he has consistently gotten raise after raise, even while being actively investigated for Garner s death, and is now making upwards of $120,000 a year.A report from Politico reads: Pantaleo earned $119,996 in fiscal year 2016, which includes earnings between July 1, 2015 and June 30, 2016. His base pay was $78,026 and he earned $23,220 in overtime, according to a review of payroll records. He received an additional $12,853 in unspecified pay, which could include retroactive pay or bonuses.Pantaleo s earnings in 2016 represent a 35 percent increase in overtime pay, and a 14 percent overall increase from the previous fiscal year, which began shortly before Garner s death on July 17, 2014.In that 12-month period, ending June 30, 2015, Pantaleo earned $105,061, with $76,488 base pay, $17,109 in overtime and $11,673 in additional earnings, records show.In fiscal year 2014, which was completed before Garner s death and Pantaleo s subsequent reassignment, he made $99,915, which included $17,189 in overtime. An investigation into Garner s killing by the Department of Justice is ongoing and the NYPD has still not released the results of their investigation. Mayor Bill DeBlasio insists that state law prevents Pantaleo s full disciplinary file from being released. This claim prompted Governor Andrew Cuomo to call bullshit and he told DeBlasio not to blame  the state law when a judge interpreted the law otherwise and your office is now contradicting the judge. So far, this is what we do know about Pantaleo s record as one of New York s finest, according to Latest.com:  Pantaleo was involved in at least three lawsuits in which he allegedly violated a (black) citizen s civil rights. He was disciplined for a bogus  stop and frisk  incident before the NYPD banned the practice. In April he was named as a defendant with the NYPD for allegedly crashing his cruiser into another man s car and injuring the driver. So in America, when a cop kills an unarmed black man with an illegal chokehold and there is video proof, not only does he get a paid vacation, he also gets one hell of a pay raise. Something is very wrong with this picture.Featured image via Latest.com"
BREAKING: WATCH TWO PROTESTERS Crash ‘Trump Assassination’ Play in NYC: “Liberal Hate Kills!” [Video],"Awesome! Two protesters crashed the  Trump Assassination  play tonight yelling  Goebbels would be proud!  and  Liberal Hate Kills!  This is the second night protesters have jumped on stage at the Shakespeare in the Park production of Julius Caesar where a modern twist shows a President Trump look-a-like assassinated. Lovely, huh?A second protester jumped on stage and yelled but a videographer capturing the moment was tackled by liberal thugs.The videographer was eventually released by the police with the assurance that the police are on their side.In case you missed the first protest on Friday night: Laura Loomer of Rebel Media rushed the stage at the controversial NYC Shakespeare in the Park performance that takes a modern twist on Julius Caesar by playing out an assassination of a President Trump look-alike. Loomer yelled  stop leftist violence  before she was escorted off stage.We re huge fans and hope more people will follow her lead. Can you imagine if the tables were turned and they performed the same play using Obama as the one to be assassinated? The double standard here is unbelievable! You have the blood of Steve Scalise on your hands! The interesting irony is that the liberal crowd screamed and yelled at her. The left loves civil disobedience -except when it spoils their enjoyment of highbrow assassination porn. Do they advocate for violence against our president?They literally have Antifa chants during Julius Caesar before Trump gets assassinated pic.twitter.com/6AbHOChSnC  Jack Posobiec   (@JackPosobiec) June 17, 2017Ms. Loomer was arrested by the the NYPD and was released within hours. Laura s press conference: Jack Posobiec also got up and bravely yelled at the crowd. He yelled  You re all Goebbels In case you don t know:GOEBBELS WAS THE NAZI PROPAGANDA MINISTER:German Nazi Party member Joseph Goebbels became Adolf Hitler s propaganda minister in 1933, which gave him power over all German radio, press, cinema, and theater.In 1925 Goebbels met the party leader Adolf Hitler. In 1926 he was made Gauleiter, or party leader, for the region of Berlin, and in 1927 he founded and became editor of the official National Socialist periodical Der Angriff (The Attack). He was elected to the Reichstag, the German parliament, in 1928. By exploiting mob emotions and by employing all modern methods of propaganda Goebbels helped Hitler into power. His work as a propagandist materially aided Hitler s rise to power in 1933. When Hitler seized power in 1933, Goebbels was appointed Reichsminister for propaganda and national enlightenment. From then until his death, Goebbels used all media of education and communications to further Nazi propagandistic aims, instilling in the Germans the concept of their leader as a veritable god and of their destiny as the rulers of the world. In 1938 he became a member of the Hitler cabinet council. Late in World War II, in 1944, Hitler placed him in charge of total mobilization. As Reichsminister for Propaganda and National Enlightenment, Goebbels was given complete control over radio, press, cinema, and theater; later he also regimented all German culture. Goebbels placed his undeniable intelligence and his brilliant insight into mass psychology entirely at the service of his party. His most virulent propaganda was against the Jews. As a hypnotic orator he was second only to Hitler, and in his staging of mass meetings and parades he was unsurpassed. Utterly cynical, he seems to have believed only in the self-justification of power. He remained loyal to Hitler until the end. On May 1, 1945, as Soviet troops were storming Berlin, Goebbels committed suicide.Via: whale"
"BREAKING BOMBSHELL: Blonde Clinton Neighbor, Dubbed The “Energizer” Gets $2 MILLION From Clinton “Charity”","Here s how Donald Trump reacted Donald Trump reacted Friday to a report that the Clinton Global Foundation provided millions to a power company partly owned by a rich, blond divorcee by saying that people have been whispering about her possible romantic ties to Bill Clinton for a long time.The  commitment  to Julie Tauber McMahon s firm from the Clinton Global Initiative was placed on its 2010 conference agenda at Clinton s urging, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.The initiative  commits $2 million to support the work of Energy Pioneer Solutions, a company founded to deliver energy savings to communities in rural America,  said a 2010 statement from the charity. People have been talking about this for years. I have no idea what went on. I certainly don t,  the presumptive GOP presidential nominee said on  Fox & Friends. According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, the Clinton Global Initiative doled out $2 million to Energy Pioneer Solutions, which is partly owned by Julie Tauber McMahon.The fit, blond mother of three, who lives just minutes from Bill and Hillary Clinton s home in Chappaqua, West chester, is the daughter of Joel Tauber, a millionaire donor to the Democratic Party.McMahon, 54, is rumored to be the woman dubbed  Energizer  by the Secret Service at the Clinton home because of her frequent visits, according to RadarOnline.Secret Service agents were even given special instructions to abandon usual protocol when the woman came by, according to journalist Ronald Kessler s tell-all book,  The First Family Detail. You don t stop her, you don t approach her, you just let her go in,  says the book, based on agents  accounts. Energizer  is described in the book as a charming visitor who sometimes brought cookies to the agents.The book describes one sun-drenched afternoon when agents took notice of the woman s revealing attire. It was a warm day, and she was wearing a low-cut tank top, and as she leaned over, her breasts were very exposed,  an agent is quoted in the book as saying. Energizer  reportedly timed her arrivals and departures around Hillary Clinton s schedule.When asked about whether there should be a probe into money directed from the foundation   a charity   to the company, Trump said:  Well, I assume you put the word  charity  in quotes. The interviewer, who cited the New York Post s cover story, told Trump that Clinton helped steer an $812,000 federal grant to the company through then-Energy Secretary Steven Chu.The interviewer also pointed out that  nonprofits are not supposed to act in anyone s private interests.

"“ALLAHU AKBAR” MUSLIM EXTREMISTS Forced Catholic Priest At Knifepoint To Kneel While They Performed “Arabic Sermon”….Filmed Beheading Of Priest…Two Terrorists Shot DEAD…19 Yr Old Was KNOWN TERRORIST Allowed To Live With Parents, Roamed Freely During Day [VIDEO]","FRANCE HAS THE BLOOD OF THIS PRIEST ON THIER HANDS! Their political correctness allowed this KNOWN TERRORIST to roam freely in the streets! Shame on their progressive values that made it possible for this beautiful 84 year old priest, who was filling in at the church to be beheaded by these monsters!  The ISIS knifemen who stormed into a church in Normandy filmed themselves butchering an elderly priest after forcing him to kneel   before they performed a  sermon in Arabic  at the altar, a terrified witness has revealed today.The 84-year-old priest, named as Jacques Hamel, had his throat cut in a Normandy church this morning in an attack that also left a nun critically injured and both jihadis dead.The two killers, who were both known to French authorities, were shot dead by police marksmen as they emerged from the building shouting  Allahu Akbar . The building was later searched for bombs.One of the extremists who stormed into the church in Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray near Rouen during mass was a French 19-year-old named Adel K., who was being monitored by electronic tag after twice attempting to join fanatics in Syria. Unbelievably, his bail terms allowed him to be unsupervised between 8.30am and 12.30pm   the attack happened between 9am and 11am.Adel K is understood to have forced the priest to kneel while his accomplice, who also lived locally and was on a terrorist watchlist, filmed the brutal killing.This afternoon it emerged that the murdered clergyman was deputising while the regular parish priest was on holiday. French authorities say they have arrested a third man over the attack   a 17-year-old man believed known as HB and believed to be a relative of Adel K.It was also revealed that the Catholic church involved was on a terrorist  hit list  found in the apartment of a suspected ISIS extremist last April.Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy called for a  merciless  response to the killing while  horrified  ex-Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin said he feared  everything is being done to trigger a war of religions .France s Socialist president Francois Hollande addresses the Islamic terror attack with the press here: A nun who was in the church during the attack said the priest was forced to the ground before his throat was slit.French authorities admitted that both of the attackers were subject to security  S  files, meaning both were known terror suspects who should have been under surveillance.Adel K. was a convicted terrorist who was meant to be living with his parents in Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray with an electronic tag on his ankle.In March 2015, while still a minor, he tried to reach the terror group s base in Syria via Germany, but was arrested in Munich.  He was placed under judicial control with his parents, but after his 18th birthday again tried to return to the Middle East.Accompanied by two childhood friends, Adel K. headed to Switzerland overland and then took a plane to Turkey, hoping to cross the border into Syria.Turkish police deported him back to Switzerland and, after being sent back to his hometown, he was tried and found guilty of  associating with a terrorist enterprise  on May 22 2015.After spending less than a year of his two-and-a-half-year sentence in prison, he was released on March 22 this year.For entire story: Daily Mail "
"FAKE NEWS WEEK: Truth, War Propaganda, CIA and Media Manipulation"," In response to the establishment media s contrived  fake news  crisis designed to marginalise independent and alternative media sources of news and analysis, 21WIRE is running its own #FakeNewsWeek campaign, where each day our editorial team at 21st Century Wire will feature media critiques and analysis of mainstream corporate media coverage of current events   exposing the government and the mainstream media as the real purveyors of  fake news  throughout modern history The Centre for Research on GlobalizationNever before has it been so important to have independent, honest voices and sources of information. We are   as a society   inundated and overwhelmed with a flood of information from a wide array of sources, but these sources of information, by and large, serve the powerful interests and individuals that own them. The main sources of information, for both public and official consumption, include the mainstream media, alternative media, academia and think tanks.The mainstream media is the most obvious in its inherent bias and manipulation. The mainstream media is owned directly by large multinational corporations, and through their boards of directors are connected with a plethora of other major global corporations and elite interests. An example of these connections can be seen through the board of Time Warner.Time Warner owns Time Magazine, HBO, Warner Bros., and CNN, among many others. The board of directors includes individuals past or presently affiliated with: the Council on Foreign Relations, the IMF, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Warburg Pincus, Phillip Morris, and AMR Corporation, among many others.Two of the most  esteemed  sources of news in the U.S. are the New York Times (referred to as  the paper of record ) and the Washington Post. The New York Times has on its board people who are past or presently affiliated with: Schering-Plough International (pharmaceuticals), the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, Chevron Corporation, Wesco Financial Corporation, Kohlberg & Company, The Charles Schwab Corporation, eBay Inc., Xerox, IBM, Ford Motor Company, Eli Lilly & Company, among others. Hardly a bastion of impartiality.And the same could be said for The Washington Post, which has on its board: Lee Bollinger, the President of Columbia University and former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and individuals associated with (past or presently): the Coca-Cola Company, New York University, Conservation International, the Council on Foreign Relations, Xerox, Catalyst, Johnson & Johnson, Target Corporation, RAND Corporation, General Motors, and the Business Council, among others.It is also important to address how the mainstream media is intertwined, often covertly and secretly, with the government. Carl Bernstein, one of the two Washington Post reporters who covered the Watergate scandal, revealed that there were over 400 American journalists who had  secretly carried out assignments for the Central Intelligence Agency. Interestingly,  the use of journalists has been among the most productive means of intelligence-gathering employed by the CIA.  Among organizations which cooperated with the CIA were the  American Broadcasting Company, the National Broadcasting Company, the Associated Press, United Press International, Reuters, Hearst Newspapers, Scripps-Howard, Newsweek magazine, the Mutual Broadcasting System, the Miami Herald and the old Saturday Evening Post and New York Herald-Tribune. By far the most valuable of these associations, according to CIA officials, have been with the New York Times, CBS and Time Inc. The CIA even ran a training program  to teach its agents to be journalists,  who were  then placed in major news organizations with help from management. These types of relationships have continued in the decades since, although perhaps more covertly and quietly than before. For example, it was revealed in 2000 that during the NATO bombing of Kosovo,  several officers from the US Army s 4th Psychological Operations (PSYOPS) Group at Ft. Bragg worked in the news division at CNN s Atlanta headquarters.  This same Army Psyop outfit had  planted stories in the U.S. media supporting the Reagan Administration s Central America policies,  which was described by the Miami Herald as a  vast psychological warfare operation of the kind the military conducts to influence a population in enemy territory.  These Army PSYOP officers also worked at National Public Radio (NPR) at the same time. The US military has, in fact, had a strong relationship with CNN.In 2008, it was reported that the Pentagon ran a major propaganda campaign by using retired Generals and former Pentagon officials to present a good picture of the administration s war-time policies. The program started in the lead-up to the Iraq War in 2003 and continued into 2009. These officials, presented as  military analysts , regurgitate government talking points and often sit on the boards of military contractors, thus having a vested interest in the subjects they are brought on to  analyze. In 2013, Public Accountability reported:During the public debate around the question of whether to attack Syria, Stephen Hadley, former national security adviser to George W. Bush, made a series of high-profile media appearances. Hadley argued strenuously for military intervention in appearances on CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, and Bloomberg TV, and authored a Washington Post op-ed headlined To stop Iran, Obama must enforce red lines with Assad. In each case, Hadley s audience was not informed that he serves as a director of Raytheon, the weapons manufacturer that makes the Tomahawk cruise missiles that were widely cited as a weapon of choice in a potential strike against Syria. Hadley earns $128,500 in annual cash compensation from the company and chairs its public affairs committee. He also owns 11,477 shares of Raytheon stock, which traded at all-time highs during the Syria debate ($77.65 on August 23, making Hadley s share s worth $891,189). Despite this financial stake, Hadley was presented to his audience as an experienced, independent national security expert.The major philanthropic foundations in the United States have often used their enormous wealth to co-opt voices of dissent and movements of resistance into channels that are safe for the powers that be. As McGeorge Bundy, former President of the Ford Foundation once said,  Everything the Foundation does is to make the world safe for Capitalism. Examples of this include philanthropies like the Rockefeller Foundation, Ford Foundation and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation providing immense financial and organizational support to Non-Governmental Organizations. Furthermore, the alternative media are often funded by these same foundations, which has the effect of influencing the direction of coverage as well as the stifling of critical analysis Learn more about the Centre for Research on Globalization and the work of its founder and editor, Professor Michel Chossudovsky, as well how to donate to them at Global Research.ca.

 Colbert Grills Sanders On His ‘Revolution For America’ — Sanders’ Response Is Brilliant (VIDEO),"Senator Bernie Sanders made an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert a day following his landslide win in New Hampshire and he was riding high. Colbert resurrected his former conservative Colbert Report character, playing devil s advocate by grilling  the senator on his polices, even suggesting that he was promoting  class warfare.  Colbert said that trying to take power away from the 1% was not going to be easy.  I ll tell you how I know, I am in the top 1 percent.  Colbert also warned of revolution which Sanders advocates by quoting John F. Kennedy. He said: Those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable. Sanders, however, rejected the idea that his revolution would go bad. He said: What the goal of this campaign is about is to look at the Civil Rights Movement, look at the women s movement, look at the gay movement, understand that when people come together we can accomplish enormous things. But I think what people are saying is enough is enough. We need fundamental changes in our political system and our economic system. Sanders is right. Thinking outside of the box is what creates both innovation and change and Sanders sums it up perfectly: We used to have a segregated society. African-Americans couldn t go to schools, couldn t drink at water fountains. Millions of people stood together and said,  Hey, enough is enough. That is not what America is supposed to be about. Americans are on board with Sanders  message. He s scored a resounding victory in New Hampshire, especially with America s youth, collecting 86% of the vote in the 18-24 age bracket. Bernie Sanders is not only running for the presidency, but thus far he s winning.Watch the video below:Featured image via video screen capture "

GREEN PARTY DOLT Struggles To Explain Wisconsin Election Recount [Video],"IAN JACKSON: People have been slightly concerned about the trail and as your last guest pointed out it s very decentralized.ED HENRYY: Uh-huh. When you say  slightly concerned,  that doesn t sound to me like there s widespread allegations or more importantly evidence of some sort of fraud. So is this giving Jill Stein supporters some sort of false hope?JACKSON: Well, I [pause] there s we re [pause] trying to find what the count is and [pause] I m not sure it s false hope. It s trying to find the truth behind the numbers. There has been these allegations by computer scientists but as your last guest pointed out, it was using different systems and using that, being engineers, um, I m a software engineer and we like our little [pause] models, but unless you actually count and check it, you don t know whether it s just a thoughy well, they used something different or if there s something to it.And you mentioned your show is all about finding truth.HENRY: Let s find that truth. My next question is, our last guest, who you cited several times, Craig Gilbert, also said, accurately, that in 2000 and 2004 the margin was even closer in the presidential race and there was no recount. So what s your case tonight?JACKSON: [pause] Well, the case [pause] tonight, you can see that there that was [pause] a real contentious election [pause], and, based on that there are people that have expressed concerns. So, it s best to find the truth and go through the process. And obviously people have been willing to put up millions of dollars [pause] to find out and count the ballots again.HENRY: Okay, so final question: if you really want to get at the truth can we get at another truth which is that it appears that Jill Stein has raised about $5 million for a recount that may or may not happen for fraud that may or may not have happened. If there s nothing found here and if there s not even a recount will you pledge tonight that you and others in the Green Party believe that that money should be refunded, so this is not just money being raised on false hope?JACKSON: Well, we re exploring that I m only treasurer for the Green-Rainbow party. We re certainly going   if it doesn t get used, we re certainly going to discuss with our donors what their desire is for that money. "
 Trump Doesn’t Want His Supporters To Know His REAL Stance On Gun-Free Zones,"Donald Trump recently went after the gun nut vote in a hard way when he declared during the National Rifle Association s annual meeting on Friday that he, as president, would get rid of  gun-free zones.  Of course, Trump didn t mention during his pandering that many of the properties that he owns could be described as gun-free zones. He also just backtracked on the issue to a large degree, days after the meeting.An official with the Trump Organization told ABC News that there are  no restrictions on licensed individuals carrying in our hotels or golf clubs. That statement turns out to be completely false. Here is a rundown of properties that ABC News discovered that do, in fact, have restrictions on carrying guns. Mar-a-Lago, Trump s posh Florida club, doesn t allow guns, a hotel staff member told ABC News.Trump National Doral, in Miami, Florida, doesn t allow guns either, a security official told ABC News. The resort would  much rather not  have guns on the property, said a security official with the hotel, who noted that guns are  not to be carried on our property. We ve had guests that have brought them before,  he said, but those guns  had to remain in their safe the whole time in the room. A security worker at Trump National in Jupiter, Florida, said  no  when asked if guns were allowed on premises by citizens who are licensed to carry them. Asked about exceptions for people like off-duty cops, the staff member directed ABC News to a supervisor, who said the hotel had no comment at all on guns at the property.Trump International Golf Club in Palm Beach County, Florida, also doesn t allow citizens with concealed carry licenses to bring their guns on the property, a golf-shop worker told ABC News. Now, of course, these policies make sense. Who would want to go to a resort or golf club to relax only to be surrounded by insecure people carrying around firearms? The same could be said for any establishment. Why should the staff or patrons at a restaurant or retail store have to deal with the person who just walked in carrying an assault weapon?So, once again we find a clear disconnect between what Trump says and reality. Maybe Trump just wants to ban all gun free zones except those that are enacted on premises that primarily serve the wealthy? As he has recently stated in another attempt to pander to the  the second amendment is the only amendment that matters  crowd, Trump stated that he thinks that teachers should be able to carry firearms on school premises.Except that, since he Trump, he can t even seem to make up his mind on that matter. On Sunday, Trump was questioned about his stance on letting teachers carry firearms during an interview on Fox & Friends. That s where he stated that: I don t want to have guns in classrooms. Although, in some cases, teachers should have guns in classrooms. That means absolutely nothing and is a far cry from what he was preaching just a few days ago and his pledge he made in January when he said: I will get rid of gun-free zones on schools   you have to   and on military bases. My first day, it gets signed, OK? My first day. There s no more gun-free zones. Trump appears to be willing to spout any NRA talking point in an attempt to pander to anyone willing to be pandered to.  In some cases  does not in any way mean a blanket throwaway policy like he has been describing for most of his campaign. Instead, he now offers this ambivalent stance on a topic that impacts millions of lives.Featured image from (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)"
BREAKING: NORTH KOREA Can Now Fit Missiles With Nuclear Warheads…Thanks Obama,"It s being reported that the markings of China s involvement in the ability of North Korea to get a nuclear warhead are there. This is disturbing to say the least!North Korea has successfully created a miniaturized nuclear warhead that can fit inside missiles, a key step in the rogue regime s ambitions to become a nuclear power, a report on Tuesday said.The findings were contained in a study by the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Washington Post reported.The newspaper also said the US calculated that North Korean President Kim Jong Un s regime now controls as many as 60 nuclear weapons.The findings show that North Korea s efforts to develop a long-range missile that can carry a nuclear warhead and strike the mainland United States is progressing more rapidly than experts had predicted.On Saturday, the United Nations Security Council voted unanimously to impose severe economic sanctions on North Korea for launching two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July.Read more: NYP"
" WATCH: Arnold Schwarzenegger Just BURNED Trump Over ‘The Apprentice,’ And It Is GOLDEN","Back in February, Donald Trump decided he was going to use the White House prayer breakfast to slam Arnold Schwarzenegger and  The Apprentice,  because the show s ratings had tumbled and there can be only one reason for that   His Trumpificence was no longer on the show. Trump asked everyone to pray for Schwarzenegger and his ratings, which he no doubt thought would get under the Terminator s skin.He couldn t have been more wrong. Van Jones just asked Schwarzenegger about this jab on his show,  The Messy Truth.  What Schwarzenegger had to say is absolute gold: It gave me an opportunity to go and shoot back and say, you know, that the show didn t do well because, you know, one-third of the audience left, because they boycotted the show because you re the executive producer, Donald Trump! He went on to say that, if Trump had just been open and honest and told everyone from the get-go that he was the executive producer, they d have had really great ratings!He also took the opportunity to poke Trump over his unconscionably thin skin, saying: I have thick skin. This doesn t bother me at all. Trump would have thrown a livid fit if their positions were reversed, but fortunately, they weren t.

 Former KKK Leader Thanks Trump’s VP For Being So Nice (AUDIO),"The most infamous leader of the Ku Klux Klan has just proven that the biggest bullies have the thinnest skins. Former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke, a Trump-loving white supremacist who spent a good chunk of his life leading a hate group, apparently doesn t like to be called bad names because it hurts his feelings.Duke let Americans in on his sensitive side when the ex-KKK leader spoke about the fact that Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence had held off on calling Duke names like  deplorable  (even though Pence has disavowed Duke s support, unlike his boss). In return for his kindness and compassion, Duke praised Pence extensively on his radio show for refusing the call Duke exactly what he is. Duke said: The whole idea that they were trying to make Pence call me names basically, and he didn t bite on that, was a real positive thing for all of us. The secret alliance between Duke and the Trump campaign is disgusting, and it has had disastrous effects. Because he was so inspired by Trump s racist and hateful presidential campaign, Duke is now running for the Senate   and why wouldn t he, when several Americans have been so accepting of the racist and anti-Semitic views that Trump holds as well? The Trump campaign has basically paved the way for people like Duke!You can listen to Duke rave about Pence below:The terrifying thing about Trump s campaign is that the GOP nominee has literally made it ok for hate speech and bigotry to be expressed publicly. He has, in many ways, normalized it in his campaign speeches, his violence-provoking rallies, and by sharing white supremacist and anti-minority messages on social media on a regular basis. Trump has made room for the most awful, divisive views to be expressed and given people like Duke the guts to have platforms they never would dared to pursue before. This is the America that Trump is creating   and it s not great. It s terrifying.Featured image via screenshot"
 Hillary SHUTS DOWN Trump Supporters Calling Her Husband A Rapist At Rally (VIDEO),"Ever since Donald Trump got exposed through an audio tape leak for bragging about how he sexually assaults women, Trump supporters have been sticking up for their favorite misogynist more than ever.Following in the Republican nominee s footsteps, their only defense against the truth in those tapes is to put blame on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton s husband, former President Bill Clinton, for the rape allegations against him.Hillary is taking this all in stride, and is completely shutting down any Trump lovers who dare hijack her rallies and distract voters from focusing on moving America forward. During a rally with Al Gore in Florida today, Clinton s talk on climate change was interrupted by Trump supporters who were yelling about her husband being a rapist. Here s a video of one such supporter, who obviously refuses to acknowledge the fact that his own candidate has several rape cases against him, one involving a minor. For 2nd day in a row, a protester has interrupted HRC by yelling:  Bill Clinton is a rapist.

They re doing it because radio host Alex Jones is offering to give anyone who can get on camera and call Bill Clinton a rapist $5,000. So basically, these people are just trying to get paid   much like Trump himself.On the upside, it looks like Hillary can t be rattled by anything Trump and his pathetic Trump supporters do at this point!Featured image via Joe Raedle / Getty Images"

 Why Conservatives Should Stop Whining About President Obama Skipping Nancy Reagan’s Funeral,"This actually happens all the time no matter who the president is, but conservatives are throwing a tantrum because President Obama does it.On Sunday, former First Lady Nancy Reagan passed away at the age of 94. Tributes have since poured in from across the country, even from President Obama himself. Nancy Reagan once wrote that nothing could prepare you for living in the White House,  Obama said in a statement. She was right, of course. But we had a head start, because we were fortunate to benefit from her proud example, and her warm and generous advice. Our former First Lady redefined the role in her time here As somebody who is lucky enough to have an extraordinary partner in my life as well, I know how much she meant not just to President Reagan but to the country as a whole. He was lucky to have her. She will be missed. That doesn t exactly sound like a man who didn t personally like or respect Mrs. Reagan. But because President Obama has decided not to attend her funeral on Friday in order to stick to his already tight schedule, conservatives are freaking out and throwing hissy fits despite the fact that this is not new.While Presidents usually attend the funerals of former Presidents, they have historically skipped the funerals of other high ranking officials and First Ladies, often sending the current First Lady to represent them at the service. Michelle Obama is, in fact, attending Nancy Reagan s funeral.President Obama will be taking part in an interview in Texas at the South by Southwest Festival, where he is also scheduled to speak about civic engagement and using technology to address the challenges we face in the future. This was planned prior to Reagan s death.Yet, conservatives see this as a sign of disrespect. The only problem is that he is hardly the first president to skip a funeral for a former First Lady.For instance, President Clinton did not attend Pat Nixon s funeral in 1993 and President Bush did not attend Lady Bird Johnson s funeral in 2007. President Obama also did not attend Betty Ford s funeral in 2011.Jimmy Carter didn t attend Mamie Eisenhower s funeral in 1979 and Franklin D. Roosevelt did not attend Lou Henry Hoover s funeral in 1944.And if conservatives seriously want to refer to Obama as  President Petty,  they should know that Ronald Reagan did not attend Bess Truman s funeral in 1982, and keep in mind that she was First Lady when her husband President Harry Truman ushered in the end of World War II by ordering the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 and was the longest lived First Lady in American history.As far as I have been able to research, the only First Ladies whose funerals have been attended by a sitting President in the last 70 years was Eleanor Roosevelt in 1962 and Jacqueline Kennedy in 1994 by President John F. Kennedy and President Bill Clinton respectively.Roosevelt had wanted a small private funeral but Kennedy attended anyway because at the time of her death, Eleanor had been known as the beloved First Lady of the World who served as First Lady during the Great Depression and World War II and is still the longest serving First Lady in American history. Jacqueline Kennedy brought grace to the White House and became a symbol of strength for a traumatized nation after the assassination of her husband in 1963. President Clinton attended her funeral because he was a friend of the family and even delivered remarks at the burial.The bottom line here is that conservatives have nothing to gripe about on this issue. Nancy Reagan s funeral is also a private one and it is quite possible that President Obama was simply not invited to attend and the only reason Michelle Obama will be in attendance is because it is a long tradition that First Ladies attend the funerals of their predecessors just as Presidents attend the funerals of their predecessors.So, there is no reason at all for conservatives to whine about President Obama choosing not to attend Nancy Reagan s funeral. He is not the one being petty.Featured Image: Wikimedia"
 Identities Of Arrested Anti-Racist Stone Mountain Protesters Released (VIDEO),"Authorities have released the identities of nine men who were arrested on April 23 during a clash between about a dozen white supremacist demonstrators, a group of counter-protesters and police in Stone Mountain, Georgia.According to WXIA, chaos broke out after a  pro-white  organization planned a rally at Stone Mountain Park on Saturday. The white supremacist group  Rock Stone Mountain  organized the demonstration to protest what they claim are  efforts to erase the white race. In response, a second group of counter-protesters called  All Out Atlanta  also staged a demonstration at the park.Only about two dozen white supremacists attended the protest, while counter protesters numbered somewhere between 200 and 300, according to local reports.Both groups were granted permits by park authorities.Police say the opposing protest groups were to be located in different areas of the park.Things went bad, however, when two members of the  pro-white  group got lost and ended up in the middle of the counter-demonstration.Police from three different agencies, dressed in riot gear, descended on the area.Video shows one of the men from the white supremacist organization referring to counter-protesters as  savages. Nine members of the counter-protest group were arrested.Eight were charged with the misdemeanor crime of  wearing a hood or mask. They were identified as:The ninth protester was identified as 21-year-old Joshua T. Taft. Taft is charged with Aggravated Assault.According to police, members of All Out Atlanta threw rocks and  got physical  with officers.Taft is accused of throwing a firework of some kind at police.Video of the arrest doesn t appear to show him resisting arrest or becoming physical with police.Here s more on the story from WXIA in Georgia. Here are two videos showing the arrests of some of the counter-protesters. It s clear from the videos that no-one is throwing rocks or fireworks at the time these people were arrested.This video was uploaded to YouTube by Regina Willis.Here s the second video via Alex Hariri on YouTube.Image credit: video screen capture via Regina Willis YouTube"
 The Latest Delusion From Devin Nunes Will Make You SICK — This Is Exactly Why He Can’t Be Trusted,"Representative Devin Nunes, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said on Wednesday that the Democrats are  not serious  about the investigation into Russia s interference in the 2016 presidential election. We re beginning to figure out who s actually serious about the investigation because it appears like the Democrats aren t really serious about this investigation,  he told reporters, according to Politico.This is the same Nunes who snuck onto the White House grounds to meet an unnamed source last week, then switched cars and ditched aides, then vanished into the night so that the next day he could make an announcement to defend alleged president Donald Trump. Nunes, while refusing to name his source, said that he had seen evidence that Trump associates were  incidentally  surveilled after the election.The top Democrat on the committee, Adam Schiff, and other Democrats, are calling for Nunes to recuse himself from the Russia probe. Nunes has refused to do so.Nunes alleges that the Democrats have not given him a witness list and added that as far as he knew they had done  very little  to read the documents provided by the intelligence agencies, according to Politico. So, at the end of the day here, we re going to get to the truth, we re going to find out who s actually doing a real investigation,  Nunes said.Nunes, who literally went around the very committee he chairs, to bring Trump  evidence  amid one of the biggest scandals to ever hit the White House, claims that Democrats aren t serious about a probe into Russia s meddling of our election.Sure, accuse the other side of what you re guilty of, Rep. Nunes.So far, only one Republican lawmaker has stepped forward to call for Nunes to recuse himself from the investigation. Hopefully, more Republicans will locate their conscience in order to disallow a hostile foreign government from underminding our election process in the future.Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images."

“YOU’RE HIRED!” Trump Pulls Unemployed Vet From Audience And Hires Her On The Spot,"No matter which candidate you support, this moment on the campaign trail is pretty awesome. Trump has said he wants to support our veterans in a big way if elected. He showed he s a man of his word when he plucked a veteran from the crowd and hired her. Instead of his catchphrase  you re fired,  Mr. Trump told the previously homeless black woman,  You re hired. Just when you think the 2016 presidential race can t get more surreal, Donald Trump reprised his role from the hit realty TV show  The Apprentice  at Washington press conference Monday and plucked an unemployed veteran out of the audience for an impromptu job interview.It was yet another unexpected twist in Mr. Trump s unconventional run that has defied the pundits, confounded the GOP establishment and made him the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination.Mr. Trump summoned the Washington press corps to the under-construction Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue, just blocks from the White House. He said the one way or another he s coming to the nation s capital.The billionaire businessman boasted that the hotel, which is being refurbished from the city s historic Old Post Office building, was being restored to the  highest level,  with luxurious suites and the largest ballroom in Washington.He said the hotel would open ahead of schedule and under budget in September.When hands went up from reporters gathered in the cavernous atrium where the hotel lobby was being built, Mr. Trump called on Alicia Watkins. HERE S THE ENCOUNTER BETWEEN TRUMP AND MS. WATKINS: Ms. Watkins, 38, a former Air Force staff sergeant who survived the 9/11 attack on the Pentagon and served in Iraq and Afghanistan, was at the press conference as a freelance writer working on an article about jobs for veterans.She briefly described her situation and complimented Mr. Trump s stance of expanding employment opportunities for veterans, and then asked if the hotel would be part of a jobs program. We are doing some of that. What are you looking for, what kind of position,  Mr. Trump asked, and then invited her to come to the podium.Pleased with her response, Mr. Trump directed her to one of his company s executives to work out a employment deal. If we can make a good deal on the salary, she s going to probably have this job,  said the real estate tycoon.Asked why he did the on-the-spot job interview, Mr. Trump said that he  felt good about her. It s a gut instinct,  he said.  I have instincts about people. Read more of this incredible story at: Washington Times "
NOT KIDDING: DEMOCRATS Are Calling For Obama To Be Hillary’s Running Mate…But Is That Legal?,"Not that the word  legal  means anything to either one of them Because Hillary Clinton is white and no longer young, a strain of political thought holds that she might lack Barack Obama s inherent appeal to new and minority voters and thus that she won t be able to ride the Democratic party s demographic advantages to easy victory in 2016.Writing for the Washington Examiner, Philip Klein ably sketches the nightmare scenario for liberals.  If Hillary s performance among black voters retreats to more typical Democratic levels,  he writes,  it will hinder her efforts in swing states such as Ohio and Florida, where Democrats need to rack up huge margins in urban areas to make up for their weaknesses in other parts of the states.   It s questionable that young voters will flock to vote at historically high levels for a 69-year-old white woman who has been a national political figure since before many of them were born. The nightmare for conservatives is a complementary scenario in which Clinton holds the Obama coalition together without issue and simultaneously increases Democratic margins among women and whites. In that world, she defeats her opponent by greater margins than Obama defeated John McCain and Mitt Romney. But there s no reason to assume that outcome is any more likely than the one Klein alluded to. And there s also no reason Democrats should tinker with a winning formula. If Clinton can turn out Obama s voters, she will win.The challenge, then, is to make sure Clinton s age and ethnicity don t discourage Obama s youthful, diverse supporters from turning out in November 2016. Fortunately, there s an easy way to make sure that doesn t happen. Clinton simply has to select Barack Obama as her running mate.LOL, you might be thinking. Obama can t be the vice president. That would place him at the top of the line of succession, and the Constitution limits him to two terms. Clinton would end up in court before she ended up in the White House if she pulled something like that.I ll grant that if Democrats nominate Barack Obama to be their vice presidential candidate next year, it would be somewhat controversial. But here Democrats can borrow tactically from the literal-minded conservatives who have seized on syntactic oddities to unravel Obama s domestic agenda. As a purely textual matter, the Constitution merely prohibits Obama from being elected to a third term. It doesn t necessarily prohibit him from actually being president again, should Hillary Clinton no longer be able to serve. And were he on the ticket, Clinton s potential liabilities with Obama loyalists would disappear.As hot takes go, this one is significantly more piping than, say, the idea that Al Gore should challenge Hillary for the nomination. My guru for this argument is Cornell University law professor Michael Dorf, though others have examined the issue, as well.There are three sections of the Constitution that prescribe limits on who can be president and vice president: Article II, the Twelfth Amendment and the Twenty-Second Amendment. While the former two limit who is  eligible  to serve natural born citizens, 35 or older the Twenty-Second Amendment begins  No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice. Whether its adopters intended it or not, the plain language of the Twenty-Second amendment doesn t prohibit a former two-term president from succeeding a sitting president and serving out the remainder of her term. It merely prohibits him from running for a third. By using the term  elected  instead of  eligible,  its authors created a loophole large enough for a Clinton-Obama ticket to coast to victory through. Via: New Republic "
FBI Release Oregon Video Footage Depicting Death of Robert Lavoy Finicum – But Questions Remain,"21st Century Wire says..UPDATE 1-29-2016 at 01:30PM ET: Due to public pressure and intense speculation about the events of Tuesday brought on by a YouTube recording of the testimony of key eyewitness Victoria Sharp, the FBI has released the unedited aerial video footage from Tuesday evening s incident which took place along Highway 395. According to the official FBI statement:  We feel that it is necessary to show the whole thing unedited in the interest of transparency.  The FBI video entitled,  Complete, Unedited Video of Joint FBI and OSP Operation 01/26/2016 , does show the victim Lavoy Finicum exiting the truck awkwardly in at least two feet of snow, and he clearly does not  charge towards  the SWAT team, and his hands are clearly held high above his head as he exits his truck when confronted by a SWAT team, before being shot multiple times by marksmen and falling in the snow. Also, the scale and size of this operation is very evident by the footage, and the apprehension of the protesters was not the result of a mere  traffic stop  as it was wrongly characterized in multiple mainstream media reports.The FBI has also titled their release as  unedited  which shows a window of 26 min and 29 seconds, but it would be interesting to see any drone footage prior to where their clip begins, to further determine how long the drone was filming the vehicles of Finicum and Bundy. This is important because it would shed further light the premeditated nature of the confrontation that the media and government  sources  have called a  traffic stop . On its own, this FBI drone footage would appear to support previous government and media claims by CNN, Washington Post and others that the victim was indeed  reaching towards his waistband  which gave federal and state police justification to unleash deadly force. However, it is still not completely clear from this aerial footage whether or not Finicum was holstered (he is said to normally carry a gun on the right hip, but FBI are claiming he had a 9mm gun in his inside left breast pocket), but also whether or not he lowered his arms before, or after he was shot multiple times. For example, if Finicum had his hands in the air and was then was shot in the abdomen first, then any man s natural reaction would be to then lower his hand(s) and clutch the wound. Additionally, if any shots were fired, even in the vicinity, then confusion could have ensued which might have prompted Finicum to reach for his weapon. Either way, it is impossible to make any such a forensic determination without a corresponding audio track  which would help to determine if any shots were fired before Finicum s hand(s) could be seen lowering.  WARNING: The following images depict violence and death which some readers may find disturbing. Watch:Watch the edited version here:  Finicum appears to temporarily lose his balance in the snow at the very moment he looks to be hit by agents.What is clear however from this video is that armed agents did not shoot to disable their suspect, but shot to kill and even had a laser sight trained on him for many minutes after he was downed. Clearly, multiple SWAT shooters could be seen emerging from the woods. After killing Finicum, police then left the victim to bleed to death laying in the snow and did not check on him for at least another 8 minutes.Flash-bang rounds can be seen around the 14:00 mark of the FBI s  unedited  version, and the FBI has said that it fired CS gas and  non lethal rounds  (possibly pepper spray rounds, or rubber bullets) are said to have been fired at the truck while the passengers were inside. This begs the question: with nonlethal rounds already in play   why did multiple SWAT shooters use so many deadly rounds against Finicum when he exited the truck with his hands up?READ MORE OREGON STANDOFF NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Oregon Files"
FAKE NEWS WEEK: Electronic Voting – The Big Lie That Just Won’t Die,"  In response to the establishment media s contrived  fake news  crisis designed to marginalise independent and alternative media sources of news and analysis, 21WIRE is running its own #FakeNewsWeek awareness campaign, where each day our editorial team at 21st Century Wire will feature media critiques and analysis of mainstream corporate media coverage of current events   exposing the government and the mainstream media as the real purveyors of  fake news  throughout modern history . Mark Anderson 21st Century WireThe U.S. government, the  intelligence  community and their malicious mainstream-media partners in deception just won t let it go.The underhanded U.S. unitary state, which seeks a unipolar world with the U.S. in charge, still says in its  never ending story  that omniscient, omnipresent Russian leader Vladimir Putin masterminded hacking the computerized systems of U.S. elections as well as Democratic National Committee computers.Then, as the stale tale goes, Russia handed all the resulting electronic juicy tidbits over to Wikileaks, which turned around and dropped a veritable information bomb on America s delicate democracy.But while that  bomb  allegedly influenced enough people to vote for the winner Donald Trump and not for loser Hillary Clinton, to this day, according to big media, we re supposed to forget all about the creepy, damning, criminally inclined things contained in the Podesta-Clinton emails themselves.So, let s try and grasp this media-massaged, intel-infused message: Even though the emails apparently had enough sizzle and scandal to boost one presidential candidate over another, we re still prodded to think that the information in the emails somehow isn t the issue even though the content of the emails will always be what matters the most.Also notice what no one, and certainly no media outlet, dares to mention regarding the other half of this issue: If Putin also was crafty enough to hack into the actual state-level U.S. election systems, then this implies that U.S. elections systems can be hacked in the first place.This is huge. Think about it the next time you use an electronic  ES&S Ivotronic touchscreen voting machine or Hart InterCivic s model at the polls.All along, we ve been reassured that the electronic voting systems used in about 95% of American voting precincts are The Greatest Thing Ever Invented and Monumentally Secure Are they really? THE ELECTORAL INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX: Securing America s automated voting systems has become a complicated affair. And, all along, writers like Yours Truly, highly credible Texas vote-reform activists like Laura Pressley, Vickie Karp, Bev Harris and others have uncovered tons of evidence that electronic elections are an immensely deceptive and vulnerable apparatus   vulnerable to external hacking and also to being  fixed  from the inside without any need for outside hacking, through the proprietary software inside the these voting contraptions that can be pre-set to steal elections if the need arises.You re going to want to see my interview with Laura Pressley, on behalf of American Free Press, through this link right here.THE RUSSIAN DISTRACTION As Pressley shows in detail, the integrity and lawfulness of Texas elections are in serious peril   not because of any outside  autocrats  like Putin and his supposed cyberspace minions, but because of state and local election officials, right here in the U.S., who absolutely will not follow state election law. And the average TV or newspaper reporter is utterly tone-deaf to these problems, which keeps the people in perpetual fog, unaware that U.S. elections have been effectively privatized by those who make the machines that count the votes.To hear more about this  Putin the Hacker  debacle, please listen to my Dec. 29, 2016 interview with UK-based radio host Andrew Carrington Hitchcock on his regularly scheduled American Free Press (AFP) show.Furthermore, check out this Election Night Gatekeepers overview on my blog by election-theft expert Jim Condit Jr., who worked with the late Collier brothers in their game-changing book,  Votescam.  The media is part of a secretive consortium that counts the vote in secret, meaning the mainstream press  fake news carries with it evidence of criminal collusion.The unavoidable conclusion is that the powers-that-be   in going after Putin and calling him The Supreme Hacker of the Known Universe  have shot themselves in the foot because they re clearly and finally admitting in the process that U.S. voting systems CAN be hacked, after more than a decade of denial.This means that all their denials about electronic election fraud are invalidated.  The critics of electronic election systems are right. The establishment is wrong. End of discussion.Meanwhile, recalling some recent history, Wayne Madsen Reports provided some important perspective: Although the Central Intelligence Agency has had a long history of undermining presidents-elect and prime ministers-elect in other countries, the United States has never witnessed the intelligence agency so blatantly attempting to politically weaken a U.S. president-elect [Trump] just a few weeks prior to the inauguration. What the CIA is doing in forcing Donald Trump into shifting from his campaign promise of restoring good relations with Russia to one of outright hostility to Moscow   favored by the CIA, Director of National Intelligence (DNI), and the neo-conservatives within the Republican and Democratic Party establishments  is nothing less than an overt threat to American democracy. WHERE ARE THE CYBER-COPS?And, as American Free Press reported in its first 2017 edition, the young owner of a Russian-based web-server company may have a handle on who stole sensitive electronic communications between Hillary Clinton and some of her advisors.But 26-year-old Vladimir Fomenko knows one thing for sure: U.S. intelligence, which professes to be hot on the trail of exposing Russian hacking, doesn t seem to care about his story.This means that our leaders in Washington have long ignored a solid lead that could prove once and for all whether or not the Russian government hacked the computers systems of top Democrats and U.S. elections systems.Fomenko recently spoke to AFP to try and demystify the controversy surrounding his King Servers company and the cyberattacks purportedly carried out at the behest of Russia.AFP writer John Friend, quoting Fomenko, noted that even though his servers were exploited in this cyber-crime:  No U.S. law enforcement or intelligence agency is interested in speaking with him to gather real evidence on the perpetrators. The U.S. was not the only country hit by computer hackers. Hackers evidently targeted Germany, Turkey, and Ukraine, apparently attempting to upset democratic processes.It was when WikiLeaks began releasing hacked data from the DNC late this past summer that media reports and the Clinton campaign began blaming Russia with no solid evidence to support that assertion.After learning about this shadowy criminal activity, Fomenko immediately shut down the servers and looked into the situation. He says he s willing to cooperate with law enforcement. We pursued an investigation without delay and found some tracks leading to Europe,  Fomenko told AFP. Web hosting is a legal enterprise  . . . regulated by law,  Fomenko added.  King Servers works in Russia, the U.S., and the Netherlands and complies with the laws of these countries. Fomenko stressed:  No U.S. law enforcement agency has contacted us at this time. Neither the FBI nor any other U.S., Russian, or Dutch intelligence agency has contacted us. The plot thickens WSB-TV Channel 2 reporters in Atlanta, Georgia actually did their job and noted:  The Georgia Secretary of State s office now confirms 10 different cyberattacks on its network all trace back to U.S. Department of Homeland Security IP addresses. Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, dissatisfied with the federal government s dodgy explanation about these DHS cyberattacks, fired off a letter to then-President-elect Donald Trump to put him in the loop.So, it ll be interesting to see if Trump ever helps Georgia, and other states whose election systems were supposedly hacked, figure out what happened and who s really responsible.After all this time, the accusation that Russia  did it  still looks less and less credible, as this additional AFP piece outlines, yet the American establishment, thinking it could blame Russia to explain Hillary s loss and come to grips with Trump s win, just won t drop the blame-Putin narrative.We can only hope that Trump s claim that he ll start putting some limits on our out-of-control spy agencies will come true. If ever there was a good reason to pursue those limits, this high-level U.S. intelligence gambit to blame Putin, no matter what, is it. The orthodox press has been a solid ally all along of these intel-intrigues.And this gives Trump a chance to prove he s the real deal, and not another asset of the establishment, despite his seemingly honest intentions to name names and seek real solutions to the real problems that are troubling Americans and citizens across the world.For, if elections are not really a means to find and assign better leaders who will use their victory as a mandate to do the right thing for the voters, then what s the point of having elections at all, hacked or not hacked, honest or not?Author Mark Anderson is an investigative journalist and features writer for American Free Press, and is editor of The Truth Hound.

“GUATEMALAN” MAN DIES After Falling Into WASTE GRINDER At Meat Plant…Former Worker Claims They Hire “90% Illegal Aliens”…Including “10-12 Yr Old Kids”,"This story is absolutely horrific, but not surprising. Bleeding heart liberals aren t doing illegal aliens any favors by fighting for them to come here, only to be abused by their employers, who hire them, and then hold their illegal immigration status over their heads when they demand safer working conditions. (See video below)A worker caught in a machine at a meat processing plant has died in Ohio, according to local authorities.Samuel Martinez, 62, was killed by the machine on Saturday afternoon at the Fresh Mark plant in Canton, Ohio.The  Guatemalan national  died at the scene.According to the Stark County Coroner s Office, the man stepped into a chute and was stuck in the waste grinder.In a statement released on Saturday, Fresh Mark said that they would work with local law enforcement to figure out what caused the accident.This afternoon just before 5 pm, we experienced a work-related fatality at our Canton facility, they said. Our primary concern rests with the wellbeing of this employee s family, as well as with the safety and well-being of all our employees in the Canton and other Fresh Mark facilities. We are working with authorities to determine the facts regarding this incident. The incident marks the second of such to happen at the company.In 2011, an employee was electrocuted while trying to plug in a fan as he was standing in water.The company sells pork related meat under the Superior and Sugardale brands.  Daily Mail In 2011, Steve Salvi, the founder of Ohio Jobs & Justice PAC interviewed an Ohio worker that made some startling allegations regarding the alleged hiring of underaged illegal aliens at one of Fresh Mark s Sugardale meatpacking plants in Canton, Ohio. In addition to outing the company for hiring underage illegal alien workers, the former Fresh Mark employee claims a veteran returned from Iraq and applied for a job at the meat processing company. The veteran was allegedly turned down until he could prove that he spoke the Spanish language.In May 2017, the very liberal New Yorker published a story about a 17-year old Guatemalan boy who was too young to work in a factory, and lost his leg due to the unsafe working conditions at neighboring Case Farms in Ohio. The New Yorker says the Case Farms plants are among the most dangerous workplaces in America.Osiel sanitized the liver-giblet chiller, a tublike contraption that cools chicken innards by cycling them through a near-freezing bath, then looked for a ladder, so that he could turn off the water valve above the machine. As usual, he said, there weren t enough ladders to go around, so he did as a supervisor had shown him: he climbed up the machine, onto the edge of the tank, and reached for the valve. His foot slipped; the machine automatically kicked on. Its paddles grabbed his left leg, pulling and twisting until it snapped at the knee and rotating it a hundred and eighty degrees, so that his toes rested on his pelvis. The machine  literally ripped off his left leg,  medical reports said, leaving it hanging by a frayed ligament and a five-inch flap of skin. Osiel was rushed to Mercy Medical Center, where surgeons amputated his lower leg.Case Farms plants are among the most dangerous workplaces in America. In 2015 alone, federal workplace-safety inspectors fined the company nearly two million dollars, and in the past seven years, it has been cited for two hundred and forty violations. That s more than any other company in the poultry industry except Tyson Foods, which has more than thirty times as many employees. David Michaels, the former head of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), called Case Farms  an outrageously dangerous place to work.  Four years before 17 year old Guatemalan worker, Osiel L pez P rez lost his leg, Michaels s inspectors had seen Case Farms employees standing on top of machines to sanitize them and warned the company that someone would get hurt. Just a week before Osiel s accident, an inspector noted in a report that Case Farms had repeatedly taken advantage of loopholes in the law and given the agency false information.  The company has a twenty-five-year track record of failing to comply with federal workplace-safety standards,  Michaels said.Case Farms has built its business by recruiting some of the world s most vulnerable immigrants, who endure harsh and at times illegal conditions that few Americans would put up with. When these workers have fought for higher pay and better conditions, the company has used their immigration status to get rid of vocal workers, avoid paying for injuries, and quash dissent. Thirty years ago, Congress passed an immigration law mandating fines and even jail time for employers who hire unauthorized workers, but trivial penalties and weak enforcement have allowed employers to evade responsibility. Under President Obama, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agreed not to investigate workers during labor disputes. Advocates worry that President Trump, whose Administration has targeted unauthorized immigrants, will scrap those agreements, emboldening employers to simply call ice anytime workers complain."
HOW THE FBI Cracked A Terror Plot On Black Friday That May Have Been Worse Than 9-11," The U.S. is the great enemy of mankind!  raved Ernesto  Che  Guevara in 1961.  Against those hyenas there is no option but extermination. We will bring the war to the imperialist enemies  very home, to his places of work and recreation. The imperialist enemy must feel like a hunted animal wherever he moves. Thus we ll destroy him! We must keep our hatred against them (the U.S.) alive and fan it to paroxysms!  -Che Guevara, head of Cuba s  Foreign Liberation Department,  Nov. 17, 1962We have a president who won t tie Islamic terrorists to Islam, has cut a one-sided deal with Iran, as they continue to chant  death to America,  and has made an open alliance with a communist country who has a long history of hating America. The same country Obama is fighting to normalize relations with, would have committed an unspeakable act of terrorism against us, had our FBI not thwarted their plans.  Why the rush to embrace so many nations and leaders who have a long history of wanting to harm us Barry?  On the morning of November 17th, 1962, FBI headquarters in Washington D.C. took on  all the trappings of a military command post,  according to historian William Breuer. The previous night an intelligence puzzle had finally come together. The resulting picture staggered the FBI men. And these had served at their posts during WWII and the height of the Cold War. They d seen plenty. Now they had mere days to foil a crime against their nation to rival Hideki Tojo s.The agents and officers were haggard and red-eyed  but seriously wired. Like hawks on a perch they d been watching the plot unfold, sweating bullets the whole time. It was nearing time to swoop down on Fidel Castro and Che Guevara s agents, busy with a terror plot that would have made ISIS drool decades later.Alan Belmont was second to J Edgar Hoover at the time. Raymond Wannall headed the Bureau s Intelligence Division. That nerve-jangling morning both were in Belmont s office just down the hall from Hoover s. Both were burning up the telephone lines to their agents in New York. On one phone they had Special Agent John Malone who ran the New York field office. On other lines they talked with several carloads of FBI agents slinking around Manhattan. These were keeping a touch-and-go, but more or less constant, surveillance on the ringleaders of the Cuban terror plot.Castro s agents had targeted Macy s, Gimbels, Bloomingdales, and Manhattan s Grand Central Station with a dozen incendiary devices and 500 kilos of TNT. The holocaust was set for detonation the following week, on the day after Thanksgiving.A little perspective: For their March 2004 Madrid subway blasts, all 10 of them, that killed and maimed almost 2,000 people, al-Qaeda used a grand total of 100 kilos of TNT. Castro and Che s agents planned to set off five times that explosive power in the three biggest department stores on earth, all packed to suffocation and pulsing with holiday cheer on the year s biggest shopping day. Macy s get s 50,000 shoppers that one day. Thousands of New Yorkers, including women and children actually, given the date and targets, probably mostly women and children were to be incinerated and entombed. ( We greeted each other as old friends,  gushed Jimmy Carter when visiting Fidel Castro in 2002.)At the time, the FBI relied heavily on  HUMINT  (Human Intelligence.) So they d expertly penetrated the plot. One by one the ringleaders were ambushed. The first was named Roberto Santiesteban and he was nabbed while walking down Riverside Drive. As the agents closed in, Santiesteban saw them and  took off! And as he ran, Santiesteban was jamming paper in his mouth and chewing furiously.But six FBI agents were after him, all fleet of foot themselves. Finally they closed the ring and  triangulated  the suspect. Santiesteban fell, raging and cursing, flailing his arms and jabbing his elbows like a maniac. They grabbed his arm and bent it behind his back just as he was reaching for his pistol.While this group got their man, another FBI squad arrested a couple named Elsa Montero and Jose Gomez-Abad as they left their apartment on West 71st Street. The FBI speculated that as many as 30 others might have been in on the plot, but these were the head honchos. Had those detonators gone off, 9/11 might be remembered as the SECOND deadliest terrorist attack on U.S. soil.Some of these plotters belonged to the New York Chapter of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, an outfit that became MUCH better known a year later on that very week. Incidentally, at the time of the Manhattan terror plot, the Fair Play For Cuba Committee also included among its members, CBS correspondent Robert Taber (an early version of Dan Rather, who conducted Castro s first network television soft-soaping on Aug. 30, 1957), along with The Nation magazine co-owner Alan Sagner. In 1996 President Clinton appointed Alan Sagner head of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.Terror-plotters Roberto Santiesteban, Elsa Montero and Jose Gomez-Abad belonged to the Castro-Cuban Mission to the U.N. and escaped prosecution by indignantly claiming  diplomatic immunity.  Via: TownhallIt s hard to imagine any American would ever consider Che Guevara to be a hero And then again, maybe it s not so hard to imagine:Maria Isabel is the campaign volunteer who hung this Che Guevara poster in the Obama campaign office in Houston, TX. She s no  low-level  volunteer either. She is a campaign  precinct captain  and the co-chair of the Houston Obama Leadership Team. "
 Right-Wing Firefighter Suspended After HORRIFIC Threat To Barack Obama (SCREENSHOTS),"It s like a day doesn t go by without some backwoods, right-wing jackass threatening the life of the President.Donald Baker of the Anchorage Fire Department was suspended after issuing threats to the President on social media. The controversy began when a reader sent a screenshot of the remark to WHAS11. Under an article titled Obama Hijacks Memorial With Sick Message  (apparently from right-wing garbage pile America s Freedom Fighters), Baker wrote that someone should  please put a bullet in this f*cker s head,  referring to  worthless piece of sh*t  Obama:When the station contacted Baker s employer, an investigation was launched. Chief William Rockwood confirmed on Thursday that the post was being investigated, and that he had suspended Baker while he determines if the department s social media policy was violated by this direct threat to the President: The Anchorage Fire Protection District finds this post extremely troubling and inappropriate. The District does not condone or allow the use of inappropriate conduct or language by its employees in person or through instant technology. Sadly, Baker is finding a lot of support on WHAS11 s Facebook page:   Some of his more vocal supporters have their own thoughts on the President:  Perhaps it s time for the Secret Service to pay Mr. Baker a visit. All too often we see threats against the President go completely unanswered   a dangerous thing when right-wing terrorism is on the rise.At minimum, Baker should definitely lose his job. After all, can he really be trusted to do his job to the best of his ability if he pulls up to a fire at a house with Democratic political signs in the yard? How deep does his bigotry go? Does it extend to all African-Americans? We are still awaiting the results of the  investigation,  but hopefully the Department does the right thing. Free speech is important, but it can and does have consequences.Featured image via screengrab"
 Trump Staff Hangs Absurdly Offensive Abraham Lincoln Banner In Mar-A-Lago Dining Room,"A few years ago, teenage pop star Justin Bieber angered many people by commenting that he thought Holocaust victim Anne Frank would have been a  belieber.  Today, the 70-year-old President of the United States and his enablers pulled a similarly bone-headed stunt. Bieber was 19 at the time. What s Trump s excuse?Visitors to Trump s Mar-a-Lago resort were shocked to find that over the weekend, his staff hung banners  honoring  Abraham Lincoln by photoshopping a  Make America Great Again  trucker hat onto the former president s head.This is genuinely hanging in Mar-a-Lago for a dinner honoring Lincoln  pic.twitter.com/sRQLtjwBi4  B (@bXbyrne) March 25, 2017The banner went up in conjunction with a Republican Party of Palm Beach County dinner to celebrate  Lincoln Day.  Honoring Lincoln apparently didn t include celebrating his actual accomplishments, but connecting him to Donald Trump.They were so proud of this feat of egomania that they distributed the picture in the dinner program as well.The cover of the 2017 Lincoln Day Dinner program for Republican Party of Palm Beach County tonight at Mar-a-Lago. @WPTV pic.twitter.com/SJPlB8V6qb  Andrew Lofholm (@AndrewLofholm) March 24, 2017The only person who might find this stunt in good taste is Donald Trump   who recently learned that Abraham Lincoln was a Republican. Great president. Most people don t even know he was a Republican. Right? Does anyone know? A lot of people don t know that. We have to build that up a little more. The Florida Republicans hosting the dinner (which, itself, is probably an ethics violation due to the fact that the current president owns the resort and will profit from it) seemed to take Trump s idea and run with it.That s an awfully big dose of wishful thinking. While it s impossible to know what a man who has been dead for 152 years would make of modern life, the idea that he would enthusiastically endorse a race-baiting grifter like Donald Trump is hard to picture. Trump couldn t even get a single living president to support him. Adding to that, the fact that Lincoln is widely regarded as perhaps America s greatest orator only makes it more unlikely that he would be impressed by a guy who can barely string two sentences together coherently.I mean, seriously  look at this garbage: Look, having nuclear my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer, Dr. John Trump at MIT; good genes, very good genes, OK, very smart, the Wharton School of Finance, very good, very smart you know, if you re a conservative Republican, if I were a liberal, if, like, OK, if I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I m one of the smartest people anywhere in the world it s true! but when you re a conservative Republican they try oh, do they do a number. It s not exactly  Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. If Lincoln were alive today, he would probably have a really articulate, beautiful way of saying  Donald Trump, go screw yourself.  I ll have to settle for saying it as plainly as that.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images"
"MI BOARD OF EDUCATION Will Allow Students To Choose Gender, Bathroom, Locker Room And Even A New Name With No Parental Consent","Every parent in the United States of America should be alarmed by this covert attempt by Board of Education members to essentially tell our kids that their power supersedes that of the parents. Furthermore, this reckless policy of placing same sex kids in bathrooms and locker rooms puts children in danger of being in private spaces with sexual predators and or sexual offenders Make sure to add your comments to the MI Board of Educations HEREMichigan s State Board of Education has drafted a guidance that would push the state s schools to allow all students, regardless of parental or doctoral input, to choose their gender, name, pronouns, and bathrooms.Spearheaded by board president John C. Austin and signed by state superintendent Brian Whiston, the guidance informs Michigan public schools that only the students themselves i.e. not their parents or doctors can determine what their individual gender identities are. The responsibility for determining a student s gender identity rests with the student. Outside confirmation from medical or mental health professionals, or documentation of legal changes, is not needed,  the guidance states.Gender identity is defined in the guidance as  a person s deeply held internal sense or psychological knowledge of their own gender, regardless of the biological sex they were assigned at birth. Notably, the guidance makes no mention of a student s age affecting whether or not they can pick a gender without their parent or doctor.In fact, the guidance seems to intentionally cut parents out of the process.The guidance states:  School staff should address students by their chosen name and pronouns that correspond to their gender identity, regardless of whether there has been a legal name change. Students can even ask to have their chosen name and gender  included in the district s information management systems, in addition to the student s legal name. But what about when school staff members are speaking with parents about their son or daughter?The guidance states that  Transgender and GNC [gender nonconforming] students have the right to decide when, with whom, and to what extent to share private information. Accordingly, the board makes clear,  When contacting the parent/guardian of a transgender or GNC student, school staff should use the student s legal name and the pronoun corresponding to the student s assigned sex at birth, unless the student or parent/guardian has specified otherwise. In other words, a boy named  Jake  could become a girl named  Jane  at school, seemingly without his parents ever knowing.Names, pronouns, and genders aren t the only things the board wants students to choose.The guidance informs schools that  Students should be allowed to use the restroom in accordance with their gender identity. And the board makes clear that single-stall bathrooms are not inclusive enough:  Alternative and non-stigmatizing options, such as an all-gender or singleuser restroom (e.g., staff bathroom or nurse s office), should be made available to students who request them, but not presented as the only option. Locker rooms also should become inclusive of students  many gender identities.  A student should not be required to use a locker room that is incongruent with their gender identity,  the guidance states.  Locker room usage should be determined on a case-by-case basis, using the guiding principles of safety and honoring the student s gender identity and expression. Students who are bothered by having members of the opposite sex in their locker rooms can request  an adjusted changing schedule  or  use of a private area in the facility. The board quietly issued the statement and guidance on February 23rd, without a press release. The public has only until April 11th to comment on the proposed guidance, according to the Department of Education website. The board will finalize the guidance at a meeting on May 10th.

SPOT ON! TRUMP SUPPORTER Slams New World Of “Guilty Until Proven Innocent” Being Used To Oust Trump [Video],"This is so worth the watch! Brit Paul Joseph Watson slams the left and their desire to invalidate the wishes of the people when they voted to elect Trump:This is one guy to follow on YouTube. Paul Joseph Watson gets to the point every time. In the second half of the video, he addresses Brexit.This comment by Jim O Connor is spot on: If our votes get to the point that they really don t matter, then paying taxes and obeying laws really won t matter then. These so called  good people  are tyrants, who want to enslave all of humanity. In 1776 a group of imperfect people stood up against such tyranny. Tyranny similar to the CIA running drugs to destroy people and fund themselves, Soros buying elections and influence, the banksters funding war, the propaganda media (no news). I hope Trump shuts down the federal reserve, shuts down the CIA and corrupt FBI, issues US currency, and puts the Satanic pedophiles in the worst prisons possible for the rest of their miserable lives. If he doesn t, the deep (creep) state will destroy his family in front of his eyes. Those in the Cabinet who voted to have Trump declared incompetent, need to be in front of a Marine firing Squad. This sedition cannot stand.  We ve been following Watson for some time. Here s a good and very funny example:"
 Something Weird Is Happening With Jared Kushner’s Hair,"Jared Kushner is an Orthodox Jew working in a White House surrounded by neo-Nazis, but he s also the son-in-law of Donald Trump, so principles be damned. Now, Kushner is normally a reasonably handsome man, if you like the boyish white collar criminal type, but lately it seems, he s been channeling some of his father-in-law s worst qualities, including (bizarrely) his hair, which he s been wearing in that famous Trump combover/swirl/whatever the hell that thing is.I think we re in big trouble now. For some reason, Jared Kushner has started styling his hair like Donald Trump.? pic.twitter.com/mvHoPGN9ps  Mike Sington (@MikeSington) April 28, 2017Jared and the kids bring treats out to the Secret Service https://t.co/TmTsUnQXZi pic.twitter.com/kvNh9V13OF  Daily Mail US (@DailyMail) April 28, 2017Twitter, obviously, has their theories.@SqueegeeSink @MikeSington Ivanka wants him to look like her dad?

Trump will notice & limp ego will get momentary rise.  SnohoMo (@SnohoMo) April 29, 2017It s entirely possible that Kushner chose this new look to impress his father-in-law, although he was made the de facto president with his old hair, so he had clearly already made the right impression.More likely, this hairdo was Trump s doing. Despite the fact that Trump is a one man What Not to Wear (ties too long, suits too big and that hair!), #45 is obsessed with what everyone around him wears. Kushner s monstrosity reportedly came courtesy of Trump s  stylist  which is located across the street from Trump s New York residence. It s not tough to imagine him telling Kushner to get  the Trump. On a subconscious level, though, this hair style speaks to more than just trying to suck up to the boss. It s about a full makeover, which with Kushner, includes his principles.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images"
 Hilarious: Trevor Noah Has More Fun Than One Guy Should With Last Week’s Debates (VIDEO),"Another huge crowd of Americans tuned in last week as the Republicans held their latest fear-fest, also known as a debate. Refusing to acknowledge that so many people have been tuning in to watch them make fools of themselves and to see what Donald Trump will say next, the GOP field of freaks took the opportunity to once again go at each other s throats for at least half of the debate while invoking fear and bashing Hillary Clinton for the other half.On the flip side, the Democratic debate   held at 9PM on a Sunday night after a long day of playoff football   drew a tenth of the audience but had a thousand times the substance. As the GOP remains focused on having Americans clutch their guns while watching out the front window for ISIS to come knocking on their doors, the Democrats were firmly planted in the world of domestic policy, discussing things that the next president will have the pleasure of dealing with here at home.Both debates had desirable outcomes. The Republicans continued making fools of themselves, alienating more independent voters in the process, in two and a half hours of Clinton bashing, fear-mongering nonsense while the Democrats finally got to see the candidates bear their teeth while Martin O malley interrupted every so often to spread his vision of a world where tree-hugging liberals will stand next to Ammon Bundy for the betterment of humanity.No matter who you support, there was plenty of material from both debates to go around. As comedians and late-night show hosts get back to work, there will be plenty of laughs to be had. Trevor Noah and the team at Comedy Central s Daily Show were the first to hit an absolute home-run with a hilarious segment that includes brutal jabs at the GOP combined with some hilarious Democratic moments as well.Trevor Noah may be having trouble with ratings and people may still not be over the loss of Jon Stewart from their Daily Show fix, but he continues to show why he was Stewart s choice to move his beloved show forward.

OBAMA’S EMBARRASSING Farewell Interview: Mom Was “Hippie” But Shaved Her Legs…Promises To Take 5-Star Mooch On “Nice Vacation…She Deserves It”,"We all know the rules are a little different for the political class. But Michelle Obama s trips overseas hardly qualify as official business. They are lavish, extravagant, and excessive by any reasonable metric. Moreover, these latest revelations are hardly isolated.They are part of continuum reaching back across to the earliest days of the Obama administration. Recently, Judicial Watch obtained flight expense records from the U.S. Department of the Air Force revealing that Michelle Obama s June 2015 trip to the United Kingdom and Italy, accompanied by her daughters and mother, cost the taxpayers $240,495.67 in flight expenses alone.The records were released in response to a Freedom of Information (FOIA) request filed on June 22, 2015. The flights to London, England; and Milan, Venice, and Vicenza, Italy, for the June 15   21, 2015, trip totaled 20:35 hours at the cost of $11,684 per hour, bringing the flight expense total to $240,495.67, according to the Air Force documents.The Obama White House, true to form, tried spin the trip as a public service that was part of Michelle Obama s campaign to push her  Let Girls Learn  initiative and  Let s Move  anti-obesity campaign.Good grief. Everyone should deny themselves and streamline their lifestyles except for the Obamas.Press reports make it evident the Obama entourage set aside substantial time for tourism. In London, Michelle Obama joined Prince Harry for afternoon tea at Kensington Palace.And the White House press office conceded that, while in Italy,  The First Lady will also visit cultural sites in Venice before returning to Washington, D.C. Judicial Watch released records revealing significant taxpayer-funded travel expenses for a Michelle Obama trip in July. Those records from the U.S. Department of the Air Force showed that Michelle Obama s 2014 trip to China cost American taxpayers $362,523.53 in travel expenses alone. Mrs. Obama, her daughters, and her mother spent March 19   26 in China, in a trip highlighted by extended visits to some of the country s most popular tourist sites.Apparently, the Obama family continues to bill the taxpayers for costly tourism jaunts thinly disguised as humanitarian crusades. If Michelle Obama wants to take tea with Prince Harry or enthuse over Da Vinci s The Last Supper, she is certainly entitled to do so, but not at taxpayer expense.Since the beginning of Barack Obama s administration, the Obamas have become increasingly notorious for unnecessary, luxurious travel, under the guise of official business.NewsmaxPresident Obama admitted he cried at a recent senior staff send-off dinner   and is now claiming that he d be able to get re-elected if he had run for president again. I am confident in this vision because I m confident that if I had run again and articulated it, I think I could ve mobilized a majority of the American people to rally behind it,  Obama said in a  The Axe Files  podcast interview by former aide David Axelrod. I know that in conversations that I ve had with people around the country, even some people who disagreed with me, they would say,  The vision, the direction that you point towards is the right one,  the outgoing president said.The Constitution limits a president to serving only two terms.Reflecting on his presidency, Obama said he s been inspired by the  heart  and  idealism  of his staff. We had our senior staff dinner   I got through about four minutes of the thing and started getting the hanky out,  he admitted.Obama said it feels like the  band  is breaking up, but that he wants to devote his post-presidency to growing the  talent  and vision that began in his two terms as president of the United States. Overall, this place never got cynical,  he said, praising the many aides he s had over the years. We never had that fire snuffed out. That is a point of pride for me,  he added.The podcast interview at times got personal, with Obama discussing his upbringing and talking about how his mom was a  hippie. But she always insisted on shaving her legs,  he told his former aide.The president also looked forward to leaving the White House, saying he s going to take his wife, Michelle, on a  nice  vacation because  she deserves it. The first family is currently in Hawaii for a two-week break before Inauguration Day on Jan. 20.  NYP "
 RESULTS ARE IN: New Post-Debate Poll Shows MAJOR Swing In Very Key Demographic (VIDEO),"It s been a couple days since the first presidential debate, but the results are finally in, and it s not looking too great for one of the two candidates, especially in regards to the women vote.According to the new post-debate  NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll: Twenty-seven percent of likely women voters said the debate made them think worse of Trump. Meanwhile, nearly a third, or 30 percent, said their opinion of Clinton had improved, compared to 22 percent of men. Women were also far likelier to say Clinton won the debate, by a 10-point margin over men. It seems as if a lot of women are really put off by Donald Trump s temperament and not only how he treated Hillary Clinton during the debate, but women in general throughout his lifetime.One woman who was interviewed for the poll even admitted that she voted for Trump in the primary, but now is leaning towards Hillary Clinton.71-year-old Joan Hume of Fairfield, Ohio said: I m undecided, but I m leaning more towards Hillary than I ever have before because of the debate. Apparently, she wanted to see Washington shaken up, but she admitted: There s a side of him that s scary to me that I m seeing more of. I thought maybe he would change when he got the nomination, but he s getting worse. And while there are some women who apparently still think Trump is an acceptable choice despite his blatant misogyny and insults towards women, it s really not looking too great for the reality TV host considering if you want to win the White House, you need to win over women. And right now, it looks like Trump is losing while Hillary is gaining.The poll states this of independent women voters: Trump fared particularly poorly with independent women when they were asked if he has the  temperament and personality to serve.  Eighty percent of independent female voters said he does not. By contrast, independent women voters were more evenly split on Clinton s personality and temperament, with 51 percent saying she met the test for president. Yikes. That doesn t look so good for Mr. Trump.Here s the thing: Trump has a very, very long history of being absolutely horrible towards women, and the women who hadn t caught on yet are now finally starting to see the bigger picture. Chances are, more will jump ship to Clinton s side before November. At least if they re aware of the reality of the situation.Here s the take from MSNBC on the topic of women and Trump:Featured Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images"
WATCH HILLARY SQUIRM When Mainstream Media Asks If She Plans To Watch “13 Hours” Movie,"Hillary was too busy to be bothered with making Benghazi a safer place for Ambassador Stevens, so it should really come as no surprise that she s too busy to watch  13 HOURS,  the true story of Benghazi. By the way, whoever told Hillary that calling the families of the four men killed in Benghazi  liars,  just as the true story of what really happened under her watch is coming out in theaters nationwide, should be fired One of the enduring mysteries of the Benghazi tragedy is why anyone ever took seriously Hillary Clinton s blaming some obscure maker of a YouTube video for the attack. That mystery, however, is dwarfed by the way the media try to pretend that Hillary s denials of that happening are anything other than bald-faced (that bald-face would be pasty white, wrinkled, and bewhiskered). In testimony elicited by the Benghazi Committee and in released emails, it has become apparent that no one ever thought the video was to blame and Clinton has, herself, attempted to claim that she never blamed the video.Now there is a new  wrinkle  to the story. Hillary told the families that the video was the cause of the attack that led to the deaths of their family members. Now she is saying they are lying.First, there is her statement when she, shamelessly, stood in the hangar at Dover AFB as the bodies of the dead men returned home:CLINTON: Many others from across the Middle East and North Africa have offered similar sentiments.This has been a difficult week for the State Department and for our country. We ve seen the heavy assault on our post in Benghazi that took the lives of those brave men. We ve seen rage and violence directed at American embassies over an awful Internet video that we had nothing to do with.Then we have the families themselves:Transcript via TownhallTyrone Woods  father (who took notes about their meeting):  I gave Hillary a hug and shook her hand. And she said we are going to have the film maker arrested who was responsible for the death of my son She said   the filmmaker who was responsible for the death of your son Sean Smith s mother:  She s absolutely lying. She told me something entirely different at the casket ceremony. She said it was because of the video. Sean Smith s uncle:  Mrs. Clinton really has a problem embracing the truth. Glen Doherty s sister:  When I think back now to that day and what she knew, it shows me a lot about her character that she would choose in that moment to basically perpetuate what she knew was untrue. On ABC s This Week, Clinton family retainer, George Stephanopoulos, revisited the issue   I have no idea why other than some misbegotten effort to  set the record straight    and got this response:https://youtu.be/jAUDS-aLGjISTEPHANOPOULOS: Did you tell them it was about the film? And what s your response?CLINTON: No. You know, look I understand the continuing grief at the loss that parents experienced with the loss of these four brave Americans. And I did testify, as you know, for 11 hours. And I answered all of these questions. Now, I can t   I can t help it the people think there has to be something else there. I said very clearly there had been a terrorist group, uh, that had taken responsibility on Facebook, um, between the time that, uh, I   you know, when I talked to my daughter, that was the latest information; we were, uh, giving it credibility. And then we learned the next day it wasn t true. In fact, they retracted it. This was a fast-moving series of events in the fog of war and I think most Americans understand that.So we have Hillary blaming the video at the arrival of the caskets. We have all four families agreeing that they were told it was a video. We have Hillary on record blaming the video in the week after the attack. And now she says it never happened.This woman is a pathological liar. The sad thing is that she could probably pass a lie detector test. Via: Red State "
 Leave It To Seth Meyers To Absolutely PUMMEL Trump’s Obvious Racism And Fraud (VIDEO),"It s gotten to the point that if you re still considering voting for Donald Trump in November, you ve got to be completely fine with voting for a scam artist and a misogynistic racist. Now, if those are things that you can overlook because of the simplistic view of party line politics, well, that s just sad, but it s your vote.Pointing out Trump s blatant racism, and ever-obvious scam artist antics is Seth Meyers on Late Night during a segment he calls  A Closer Look.  Meyers informed his audience of what Trump University is   fraud.He said: Trump University was founded in 2005, promising to teach people how to make money off real estate. But, as the Washington Post reported, it wasn t a university or even a school; it was just  a series of seminars held in hotel ballrooms across the country.' Meyers then compared getting a degree in business at Trump University is about as valid as getting a medical degree at the Holiday Inn Express. He also pointed out that Trump University is so bad, and so fraudulent, that it scammed mothers trying to feed their kids and even Bernie Madoff would say,  Wow, dog, that s not cool. Not only did Meyers go elbow deep into describing how much of a scam artist Trump is, but also how racist he is. He perfectly summarized it with this one statement: Now to be clear, claiming that someone is not able to do their job because of their race is, by definition, racism. Period. And in regards to Trump pointing and calling out his  African-American  and Republicans all of a sudden seeming to realize Trump is racist, Meyers said: Republicans can t pretend to suddenly be shocked and offended, this is who Trump was well before this latest outburst, and this is who [the GOP is] lining up to support  So remember this when Trump inevitably tries to convince you he s not a racist. Because guess what? He is.Watch the segment here:Featured image via video screen capture"

ETHIOPIAN MUSLIM Monster Deported From U.S. 10 Years After Performing “Clitorectomy” On Daughter With Scissors,"With a growing number of Muslim refugees and immigrants living in America who are strict adherents of Sharia Law, it should come as no surprise that female genital mutilation is not so uncommon anymore in many parts of the United States. It is a felony to perform a clitorectomy on a female in America, but getting caught is the hard part A petition from the womens  group Equality Now reveals that immigration has put the United States on a list that will be much more difficult for progressive immigration enthusiasts to cheer. A massive influx of immigrants from Muslim-populated countries in Africa and the Middle East has led the group to conclude that more than half a million girls in the U.S. are in danger of having their exposed sexual organs skinned from their bodies.The practice is known as female genital mutilation (FGM).The Atlantic describes how the procedure is carried out:It usually involves the complete removal of the clitoris, and often the removal of some of the inner and outer labia. In its most extreme form infibulation almost all the external genitalia are cut away, the remaining flesh from the outer labia is sewn together, or infibulated, and the girl s legs are bound from ankle to waist for several weeks while scar tissue closes up the vagina almost completely. A small hole, typically about the diameter of a pencil, is left for urination and menstruation. The cutting is usually done with a razor, a kitchen knife, or a pair of scissors. It is rare for any anesthesia to be used.As the United States continues to mail out immigrant visas to countries with hostile and violent attitudes towards women, it will increasingly challenge Americans  self-perception of what it means to live in a First World country.Haha Dukureh, an FGM-survivor and founder of the activist organization Safe Hands for Girls, warned that  every year thousands of girls here in the United States go through female genital mutilation.   Breitbart NewsA Gwinnett County Muslim man was deported today after female  serving 10 years in an American prison (on the American taxpayer dime) for a genital mutilation sentence. An Ethiopian man convicted of aggravated battery and cruelty to children was removed from the United States on Monday.Khalid Adem, 41, was arrested for using scissors to mutilate the genitals of his 2-year-old daughter.He was deported on Monday after serving 10 years in prison.Adem was an Ethiopian citizen and native when he was living in Gwinnett County, Georgia in 2006. (He was convicted in 2006, but his wife who turned him in believes the crime was committed in 2001). His case was drew national attention for being the first criminal conviction in the United States for female genital mutilation (FGM).He became the catalyst for the specific criminalization of FGM under Georgia state law.Female genital mutilation is a federal crime, and any involvement in committing this crime is a human rights violation that results in imprisonment and potential deportation. (This crime includes doing the procedure within the United States as well as sending women overseas to be cut) .  Jihad Watch"

 ‘Millennials Rising’ Republican Super PAC Almost Entirely Funded By One 72-Year-Old White Guy,"If there is one thing that s immediately clear by attending a Republican presidential rally or looking at the demographics of Fox News it s that the modern Republican Party is not so  modern  after all. They are old. And each year, they lose more of their supporters to Father Time, while being replaced by a far more progressive youth.Understanding the basic math of this problem can sends shivers down the spine of a Republican political operative. How can they expect to compete with the Democratic Party with their supporters entering their 70s? Sadly, the most obvious answer   update your archaic policy positions, stupid!   never occurs to them. Instead, they are going to try to  fake it.  They ll pretend to be cool.One shot at this sad new attempt to cling onto relevancy comes in the form of  Millennials Rising,  a conservative Super PAC that aims to show the youth that the Republican Party can be  hip  and  dope  and  on fleek.  Their ads are pathetic as they sound.Here s one supporting Jeb Bush:Seems like it was made by an old guy desperately trying to figure out what is cool, right? That s because it kind of was.In an investigation by The Intercept, reporters found that  Millinnials Rising  is 95 percent funded by old rich guys. The principle backer is a 72-year-old billionaire who  earned  his fortune by being the grandson of an oil baron.Of the $54,960 total raised by the Super PAC, $50,000, or 91 percent, comes from the snowy-haired, 72-year-old billionaire Robert A. Day. He is the grandson of Superior Oil founder William Myron Keck and a former investment manager. Day has also given $1 million to the pro-Bush Super PAC Right to Rise.The rest of the Super PAC s backers are all about equally far into their golden years.Zooming out, the silliness of a bunch of rich old guys funding a Super PAC intended for 18-year-olds is exactly why the Republican Party is such a mess. Rather than come to accept that things like homophobia and regressive social safety net positions are out of sync with where America   especially its young people   are at, they try to throw money at the problem. Unfortunately, all the Instagram filters and Vine loops in the world can t convince young people that Republicans aren t the party of backwards policies.To give us a sense of what is coming, Mitt Romney desperately tried to win the  Millennial  vote in 2012 by throwing a fortune into ads at them   he still lost them 2 to 1.Obama easily won the youth vote nationally, 67 percent to 30 percent, with young voters proving the decisive difference in Florida, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio, according to an analysis by the Center for Research and Information on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University.It wasn t even close.Feature image via YouTube"
 Reporter: How Creepy Donald Trump ‘Hit On’ Me Today (TWEET),"Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump allegedly hit on a journalist on Monday. According to Karen Attiah, deputy digital editor for the Washington Post, Trump told her she was  beautiful  as she asked him a detailed question about his policies on racial inclusion. The incident happened as Trump met with the editorial board of the Washington Post on Monday.So. I got hit on today by Donald Trump.  Karen Attiah (@KarenAttiah) March 21, 2016As the meeting ended and we were walking out of the room, I thanked Trump for taking my question. He turned to me and said,  I really hope I answered your question,  and added casually with a smile,  Beautiful.  I was stunned. I didn t say thank you, and I don t think I smiled. He then walked out to meet with my Post colleagues briefly before heading to the elevator.I stayed in the conference room for a few minutes as it sunk in that the potential GOP nominee for president thought it was okay to comment on my appearance. Did he just say that?The moment made Attiah think about how Trump views the world, noting that, In Trump s world, commenting on a woman s appearance in a professional setting is fair game. She added:At least now I know, firsthand, that the sexism that Trump puts on display against Megyn Kelly under the lights of national TV is not that much different from how he is in real life toward female journalists.Trump has a history of bizarre behavior and language directed towards women.Appearing on the Howard Stern radio show, Trump discussed Latina actress Eva Longoria, telling Stern: She s really cute, I have to tell you, she s really bouncy, really cute. She s about five foot one. Do you like girls that are five foot one? They come up to you know where. He added: You have to get started, you have to like short girls. She s very, very short. You know, she goes out with a basketball player, which is interesting but she s very short. In other clips from his appearances on Stern, Trump could be heard ranking, rating and degrading various women. For instance:In one instance, Trump ranked his top 10 most beautiful women, and while his then-girlfriend Melania Knauss took the top spot, Trump told Stern he definitely would have sex with Mariah Carey, Cindy Crawford, and Princess Diana, who also made the list. In another appearance, Trump assigned each of the actors on ABC s Desperate Housewives a score of 1 to 10 based on their attractiveness. He said of one of the actors, Nicollette Sheridan:  A person who is very flat-chested is very hard to be a 10.  When he got to Marcia Cross, he asked Stern,  Would you go out with Marcia Cross or would you turn gay, Howard? Trump has a problem with women, particularly assertive women in a position of authority. This incident just appears to be more evidence of that.Featured image via Twitter/Flickr"
LOL! Democrat Congressman Says Best Way To Fight “Fake News” Is To Watch MSNBC [VIDEO],"MSNBC host asks Congressman Ted Leiu, a Democrat from California about a House resolution he co-sponsored to address  fake news.

Leiu then goes on to actually  thank  MSNBC for  speaking truth to power.

He was punished in February 2015 for lying about a helicopter ride in Iraq that he claimed came under heavy enemy fire.In 2003, Williams and an NBC team were reporting in Iraq when three Chinook helicopters came under fire.Williams claimed he was on one of the copters that were hit, when he aboard a different helicopter located about an hour behind the other three. I don t know what screwed up in my mind that caused me to conflate one aircraft with another,  Williams told  Stars and Stripes  after crew members from the helicopters that were hit that day came forward.Questions were also raised about Williams  coverage in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005.Williams claimed he could see bodies in flooding from his hotel room in the French Quarter.But the New Orleans Advocate reported that the French Quarter was largely spared in the catastrophe and saw little flooding.-NYP"
"WRONG COLOR: If Left Really Cared About Police Brutality, They’d Be Protesting Death Of White 6 Yr Old Autistic Boy Whose Dad Was Unarmed With “Hands Up” [VIDEO]","As it turns out, police brutality really isn t the issue at all. It s about dividing a nation down racial lines and the good police men and women are just part of a scheme by the Left that is being orchestrated in the highest office of our nation Police investigating the fatal shooting of a six-year-old autistic boy by two Louisiana state marshals are looking into whether one of the cops had a grudge with the child s father.Jeremy Mardis was shot five times in the head and chest as he sat in the passenger seat of his father Chris Few s car last week by officers Derrick Stafford, 32, and Norris Greenhouse.Investigators are exploring the possibility that Greenhouse, 23, had a personal issue with Few, after Few s fianc e Megan Dixon said the marshal had been messaging her on Facebook and coming round to their home.Ms Dixon has previously said she  was the reason this all started , adding that she knew what happened in the moments leading up to the shooting.Few and Ms Dixon were drinking Budweisers and shots of tequila in T.J. s Lounge and pool bar that evening before getting into an argument, the Denver Post reported.She announced to the bar that they were not seeing each other any more and started dancing with one of the barmen.Few reportedly stormed out of the bar, kicking a door as he left, before getting into a blazing row with Ms Dixon in the parking lot.They drove off in different vehicles and someone called 911.A short while later, after Few had picked up Jeremy, he pulled up next to Ms Dixon at a red light and asked her to come home with him. She said she declined because she was  stubborn .As she pulled away, Ms Dixon said she saw two marshals  cars approaching from behind with their lights flashing.She said she saw Few was pointing at his son s head, showing that he was in the car and he wasn t sure what to do.According to investigators, Few drove down a cul-de-sac as marshals Greenhouse and Stafford came round the corner.Police say Few started reversing and at this point the men opened fire, pumping 18 bullets into the SUV, five of which hit Jeremy in the head and chest.Police are investigating whether Greenhouse (left) had a grudge with Few, who was said to have confronted the cop over Facebook messages and visit to his fiancee. Pictured right, StaffordFew s attorney says footage from a bodycam worn by one of the cops shows the father putting his hands up before the officers started firing.Col. Edmonson on Friday described the footage as  the most disturbing thing I ve seen .He added:  That video was incredible. I mean, as a father, much less head of the state police, I looked at that tape, I said this is incredibly disturbing. Initial reports suggested the marshals had a warrant but it was subsequently discovered that they did not, and it is not known why they pursued Few.Greenhouse and Stafford were charged with second-degree murder and attempted second-degree murder. They are being held on $1million bonds.As you can see here, these two cops were about as bad as two cops can be. Since neither of them are white, and the victim is white, this is a non-story to the citizens who are reportedly  so concerned  about police brutality: Via: Daily Mail "
 Fox News Despicably Blames THIS For The Belgium Attacks Instead Of The Terrorists (VIDEO),"Rather than placing the blame for the terrorist attacks in Brussels with the terrorists where it belongs, Fox News focused on blaming something totally unrelated instead.On multiple occasions during their coverage of the bombings that took the lives of over 30 people in Brussels on Tuesday morning, Fox News hosts and contributors all made sure to blame political correctness for the attacks, even though acting like a decent human being had nothing to do with the evil acts committed by a group of extremists.In a video compilation put together by Mediaite, several Fox hosts and contributors are shown citing political correctness as the cause of the attacks and urging Americans to disregard any consideration of the feelings of people who are discriminated against. As long as political correctness and fear of being called a bigot dominate we can t have the conversation,  said one Fox contributor at the beginning of the video. Another alluded to Donald Trump and how he is leading the Republican primary because he isn t politically correct, because that s somehow something to be proud of.Yet another Fox talking head called for dropping political correctness because that the only way to  protect the homeland.  There was even a suggestion that the only way to fix the threat of terrorism in our world is end political correctness. One Fox nut even claimed that political correctness is  literally killing us in this country.  Laura Ingraham even repeated that being PC can kill. Fox also complained about how they are hit with charges of Islamophobia whenever they cover ISIS and terrorist attacks.Here s the video via YouTube.But the problem is not that Fox is covering ISIS and terrorist attacks, it s that they usually always attack ALL Muslims as if the entire Muslim population is guilty of the attacks committed by a few religious extremists who do not represent the Muslim world, just like the KKK doesn t represent all Christians here in America.Being politically correct does not cause terrorist attacks. Hate and intolerance does and you won t hear Fox News talk about that at all. They d rather waste their time whining about how they can t be hateful and intolerant of Muslims without being called out for being the racists they are.It s important that we treat innocent Muslims with respect and dignity during this tragic time. Discriminating against them also makes things worse and gives ISIS new potential recruits to target.For a  news  outlet that constantly claims to be aligned with Christianity, Fox News sure does like war, hate, and bigotry when what we need right now is love and unity.Also, how much more despicable can Fox News get using yet another terrible deadly act of violence to push their own political agenda instead of simply reporting the news and showing sympathy to the dead?Featured image via screen capture"
WHY ARE GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK ATTENDING BILDERBERG’S 2015 LUXURY SECRET POLICY CONFERENCE?,"Why are banking powerhouses, European Prime Ministers, a major arms manufacturer, a representative from the US State Department, Facebook and Google all attending the same secret policy summit? One of Bilderberg s founders and steering committee member, Denis Healey said in 2001:  To say we were striving for a one-world government is exaggerated, but not wholly unfair. Those of us in Bilderberg felt we couldn t go on forever fighting one another for nothing and killing people and rendering millions homeless. So we felt that a single community throughout the world would be a good thing. From The Guardian: As one summit closes, another opens. Thursday sees the start of the influential Bilderberg policy conference, which this year is being held in Austria, just 16 miles south of the G7 summit, and in a similarly inaccessible luxury alpine resort. The participant list for the conference has just been released by the organisation, and some big names leap off the page.No fewer than three serving European prime ministers will be attending, from the Netherlands, Finland and Belgium. They will be discussing  European strategy  with the head of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg, and the president of Austria, Heinz Fischer. Two European finance ministers are on the list: one Dutch, the other George Osborne. The UK chancellor is a regular attendee of the Bilderberg summit, and this year he will be showing off his post-election glow. Unlike that other Bilderberg regular, Ed Balls, who is being invited back despite having by some considerable distance the weakest job title on the list:  former shadow chancellor of the exchequer.Europe s hottest financial potato, Greece, is on the conference agenda, and it s good to know Beno t Coeur , a member of the executive board of the European Central Bank, will be there to discuss it in strictest privacy with interested parties, such as the heads of Deutsche Bank, Lazard, Banco Santander and HSBC.The scandal-hit HSBC and everyone s favourite vampire squid, Goldman Sachs, are both extremely well represented at this year s conference. HSBC in particular by its chairman, its busy chief legal officer, and board member Rona Fairhead, who is also on the board of PepsiCo and chair of the BBC Trust. Good to know the BBC is in such safe hands.Other financial luminaries on the list include the vice-chairman of BlackRock, the CEO of JP Morgan Asset Management and the president of the Royal Bank of Canada, which is the nation s largest financial institution. Morgan Stanley will be represented in Telfs by board member Klaus Kleinfeld, who also runs the world s third largest aluminium producer, Alcoa.From the worlds of industry and manufacturing are some eye-wateringly big names. The CEO of Michelin is invited, along with the head of Roche, the CEO of Royal Dutch Shell, the chairman of BP, the CEO of Siemens Austria and the heads of various industrial conglomerates such as Techint and Investor AB, companies so large they re hard to classify. Although  gigantic  goes some way towards it.It s a heady step up into the big league for Michael O Leary, the CEO of Ryanair. He ll doubtless be hoping to thrash out a few last-minute deals over dinner with the head of Airbus, Thomas Enders.Apart from making holiday jets, Airbus is also one of the world s biggest arms manufacturers, and the 2015 conference agenda has a distinct whiff of war. Chemical weapons threats and Nato are both set to be discussed. Luckily the head of Nato is there to discuss it.As ever, foreign policy formation is a big part of the conference. Terrorism and Iran both make the agenda this year, and participants can expect a high-level briefing from senior US State Department official John R Allen, the special presidential envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter Isil. And it s likely that the subject of Russia will be of interest to the German defence minister and deputy defence minister, both of whom have found the time this week to be in Telfs. As has the head of the Danish intelligence service, who will likely have a part to play in the session of cybersecurity.Finally, it s worth noting the growing presence of Google at Bilderberg. The company s executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, is on the group s steering committee; he ll be joined in Austria by his vice-president for engineering, advanced technology and projects, and the vice-president of engineering for the not-at-all terrifying sounding Google DeepMind. They, presumably, will be leading the session on artificial intelligence. This will be listened to with great interest by Peter Thiel, the founder of PayPal and director of Facebook, as he continues his quest to merge with computers. But that s another story.For now, the story is: Bilderberg 2015 has an extremely high-powered participant list, featuring a large number of senior politicians and public figures. With participants this powerful, and an agenda containing this many hot topics, the Telfs policy conference is sure to be covered in depth by the world s press. And by  sure to be , I mean probably won t be. For reasons that, as ever, escape me.Via: The Guardian "
 Fox News Humiliates Mitt Romney For Flip-Flopping On Donald Trump (VIDEO),"Mitt Romney looked like a defeated man too embarrassed to admit that the rise of Donald Trump is partly his fault.During an appearance on Fox News Sunday, the former Republican presidential nominee  was forced to confront the reality that accepting Donald Trump s endorsement in 2012 legitimized the current Republican front-runner among conservative voters.Fox host Chris Wallace mentioned that Romney  had a very different view of him four years ago when he endorsed you,  and proceeded to remind Romney of that endorsement by playing video of him accepting it and touting Trump as a successful businessman in the process.Romney responded by saying that just because someone endorsed him doesn t mean he thinks they can be president.  Sixty-one million people voted for me,,  Romney said.  I don t think all 61 million ought to be president of the United States. But Wallace hit Romney like a ton of bricks by pointing out that Romney is flip-flopping, a charge that hurt Romney repeatedly during the 2012 Election.As Romney sat and listened in defeated silence, Wallace told him that most of the business failures Romney listed during his anti-Trump speech actually occurred prior to 2012 when Romney praised Trump s business experience and knowledge of how the economy works. But you were talking at the time about his extraordinary ability to create jobs, his understanding of the economy. It s not like   Donald Trump   everything you believe he did wrong has happened in the last four years. A lot of those business failures you talk about happened before 2012. Before 2012, he was making the birther argument that President Obama needed to show his birth certificate because he wasn t born in the United States. I guess part of the question is, by legitimizing him back then, were you part of the reason he is where he is now? Rather than answer for the flip-flopping, Romney attacked Trump and his policies, saying that they aren t good for America or the Republicans Party.Here s the video via YouTube.Sorry, Mitt. It s a little too late to come out against Trump. Like, four years too late.Featured image via screen capture"
 Texas Schools Proposed Textbooks : Mexicans Are Lazy And Want To Destroy Society,"Texas textbooks are once again in the limelight. After years of asking for ethnic studies, they finally offered them. The only problem is that the books are teaching young minds the Donald Trump message   that Mexicans are lazy and want to destroy the country.School textbooks in Texas have long been a source of controversy because Texas textbook writers play more than a little loose with facts. The books whitewash slavery and the Civil War, they completely ignore the existence of the KKK and of the Jim Crow era. They mention segregation, but only as a footnote and only as something that s not that bad.Texas science books teach creationism, that the earth is 6,000 years old and that there s no such thing as climate change. Now, they are teaching pure racism and xenophobia and kids across the nation could be learning those lessons.Not surprisingly, Republicans outnumber Democrats in the Texas Board of Education by two to one. Democrats have been trying for two years to create a Mexican-American studies program, which makes perfect sense since the majority of Texas public school children are Latino.Republicans on the board balked at the idea, but they finally caved, sort of. There are now Mexican-American studies, but they are as racist as a Donald Trump rally or as the GOP convention happening in Cleveland.(Attorney with the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Celina) Moreno and other activists are part of the new Responsible Ethnic Studies Text Coalition, which scrutinized the proposed textbooks and detailed what it described as  multiple factual errors.  The coalition said those included suggesting that Mexican culture promotes laziness, linking Mexican-Americans to immigrants who are not in the country legally, and characterizing leaders of the Chicano movement that advanced Mexican-American civil rights in the 1960s and  70s as adopting  a revolutionary narrative that opposed Western civilization and wanted to destroy this society. Industrialists were very driven, competitive men,  the textbook says, according to excerpts.  In contrast, Mexican laborers were not reared to put in a full day s work so vigorously. There was a cultural attitude of  manana,  or  tomorrow.' Source: My San AntonioRepublicans evan admit that they did it just to piss Democrats off.You ought to be careful what you ask for. You got it,  (Board member, David) Bradley, a Republican from Beaumont, said in a phone interview.He said Texas should focus on basics like reading, writing and math before worrying about more specialized courses. I m Italian, Irish and French,  Bradley said.  And I feel like I m being discriminated against when we only have an exclusive minority studies program in Texas. the books aren t out yet. They are up for a vote in November, but the really frightening thing is that if they are published, students around the nation could be reading that Mexicans are lazy.Featured image via Pixabay.  "
 NY Attorney General On Trump University: ‘This Is Straight Up Fraud’ (VIDEO),"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is trying really hard to ignore the controversy and lawsuit surrounding Trump University. Earlier this week he even attacked the media because they had the audacity to do their jobs and report on the lengths the university went to in their efforts to defraud people of their money. On Thursday, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman appeared on MSNBC s Morning Joe to discuss Trump U and said the university was not legitimate and the GOP nominee knew it. This is straight up fraud. It s like selling people something you say is a Mercedes and it turns out to be a Volkswagen,  Schneiderman said.  And even if some people say,  Well actually, I kind of like the Volkswagen,  it s still fraud because it s not a Mercedes. This was not a university. Although Trump claims that he will be vindicated and Trump U was completely above-board, the details of the three lawsuits against him tell a different story. During an interview with Fox News in February, the billionaire claimed that he  handpicked the staff for the school and those people did a  good job.  AG Schneiderman told the hosts at Morning Joe that those statements were blatant lies: Trump s role was really as the pitchman. And we ve got his videotapes, and we ve got his sworn testimony which undercuts every statement in the videotapes. He said,  My hand-picked experts will teach you my personal secrets.  He and the president of the university have already testified under oath he never met the instructors, they weren t hand-picked. They weren t experts   some of them came out of fast food and retail. And he had nothing to do with the supposed secrets that were taught because he had nothing to do with the curriculum.The attorney general added that Trump scammed these people during one of the worst economic times in American history: So people were led to believe they were getting the personal secrets of Trump, during hard economic times, we re talking about 2008, 2009, 2010. People wanted to scramble to find a way to make money, he duped them in, thousands of people paid millions of dollars and we re out to get them their money back. Think about what all of this means for a minute. Before the housing market collapse, Trump said that he wanted the bubble to burst so that he could make money. That eventually happened and millions of Americans suffered greatly. People lost their homes, their jobs, their savings, it was horrific. So, after he prayed for their demise by wishing the crash would happen, he convinced people to go to Trump University so that they could get out of the holes they were in and become rich like him   but it was all a scam. Now this same person is running for president and he is one step away from the most powerful position in the world. How did he get there? By, once again, scamming people into believing that he will save them.Donald Trump is a horrible human being and we must come together and keep him out of the Oval Office. So, remember, vote blue   no matter who.Watch:NY @AGSchneiderman on Trump U: This is just straight up fraud https://t.co/OUjj1BEt81  Morning Joe (@Morning_Joe) June 2, 2016Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images"
 Here You Go: Every Bat Sh*t Crazy Thing That Came Out Of Trump’s Mouth In The First Debate,"Donald Trump spent Monday night making a total ass out of himself in the first presidential debate. We were all waiting to see just what would happen tonight, and it was quite the spectacle. From lies to self-incrimination, watching the GOP nominee s performance was the equivalent of one facepalm after another.So here you go, a complete list of every batshit crazy thing that came out of Donald Trump s mouth during the first presidential debate: There s nobody in our government to fight them [China], and we have a very good fight, and we have a winning fight. They re using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China and many other countries are doing the same thing. We have to stop these countries from stealing our companies. Our country s in deep trouble.  We don t know what we re doing with devaluations  Especially when it comes to China, they re the best.  They re the best ever at it. What they re doing to us is a very very sad thing. That s called business, by the way.  (referring to making money off of the 2007 financial collapse) I m a great believer in all forms of energy  Our country is losing a so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt. I will bring back jobs.  You can t bring back jobs. That s about all you ve got.  (referring to Clinton s book We Are Stronger Together) You are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history.  You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history.  You are going to drive businesses out. I m going to cut taxes, big-league.  You are going to raise taxes, big-league. And take a look at mine also.  (referring to his campaign website) She tells us how to fight ISIS on her website.  I don t think Douglas MacArthur would like that too much  You re telling the enemy everything you want to do.  No wonder you ve been fighting ISIS your entire adult life. Well, I m really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going to create tremendous jobs.  They re going to expand their companies.  They re going to do a tremendous job.  (hahahaha) I m getting rid of the carried interest provision, and if you really look, it s really not a great thing for the wealthy, it s really a great thing for middle class.  (methinks thou dost protest too much) These people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies.  And when they re going to bring 2.5 trillion dollars back from overseas, where they can t bring the money back because politicians like Secretary Clinton won t allow them to bring the money back because the taxes are so onerous and the bureaucratic red tape is so bad.  (or because those companies are greedy and un-American, just saying) So, what they re doing is leaving our country, and believe it or not, they re leaving our country because the taxes are too high.  Because some of them companies have lots of money outside our country, and instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work because they can t work out a deal.  And everybody agrees it should be brought back, instead of that they re leaving our country to get their money because they can t bring their money back into our country, because of bureacratic red tape.  Because they can t get together, because we have a President that can t sit them around a table, and get them to approve something.   (maybe companies should just pay their taxes so we don t need to cut valuable public services) We have no leadership, and honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton  Why not [blame Clinton for everything]? We re in a bubble right now, and the only thing that looks good is the stock market. We have a FED that is doing political things  the FED is being more political than Secretary Clinton When we have a country that s doing so badly, that s being ripped off by every single country in the world, it s the kind of thinking that our country needs. We have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals.  (in response to a question about his taxes) I ve been under audit for almost 15 years.  I know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited.  I say,  Have you been audited?   I get audited almost every year, and in a way I should be complaining.  I m not even complaining.  I don t mind it.  It s almost become a way of life.  I get audited by the IRS, but other people don t. We have a situation in this country that needs to be taken care of.  I will release my tax returns against my lawyers wishes That makes me smart.  (in response to paying zero dollars in federal income taxes) I could give you a list of banks, if that would help you.  I would give you a list of banks.  These are very fine institutions, very fine banks.  I could do that very quickly. I have a tremendous income.  The reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way. It s about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money. Our airports are like from a third world country  We ve become a third world country.  The worst of all things has happened. And it s really a shame. And it s politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem. Our country has tremendous problems. We re a debtor nation. We re a serious debtor nation. And we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals. And we don t have the money, because it s been squandered on so many of your ideas. It would be squandered, too, believe me.  (in response to not paying any federal income taxes) Maybe he didn t do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work  Which our country should do, too.  (referring to not paying people who worked for him) But on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there. And when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didn t get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation.  Now, if you want to change the laws, you ve been there a long time, change the laws. But I take advantage of the laws of the nation because I m running a company. My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies. And that s what I do.  (referring to bankrupting four companies and not paying his business debts) But what she doesn t say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me. I ll give you an example. We re just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I don t get there one way, I m going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another. When we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy. Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn t want to use a couple of words, and that s law and order. And we need law and order. If we don t have it, we re not going to have a country. Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York. We have to be   we have to know what we re doing. Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything. No, you re wrong. It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge. It was taken away from her. And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would have won an appeal. If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where it s allowed.  (referring to racial profiling becoming outlawed as unconstitutional) We need law and order. And we need law and order in the inner cities, because the people that are most affected by what s happening are African-American and Hispanic people. And it s very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen. I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I m very proud of. These are very, very good people. But I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists. And when people are on there, even if they shouldn t be on there, we ll help them, we ll help them legally, we ll help them get off. But I tend to agree with that quite strongly. But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did. It had a very, very big impact. They ve been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians, because that s what it is. They ve controlled these communities for up to 100 years. You know, you ve seen me, I ve been all over the place. You decided to stay home, and that s OK. But I will tell you, I ve been all over. And I ve met some of the greatest people I ll ever meet within these communities. When I got involved, I didn t fail. I got him to give the birth certificate. So I m satisfied with it. And I ll tell you why I m satisfied with it But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate. And I think I did a good job Well, it was very   I say nothing. I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it. He should have produced it a long time before. I say nothing. But let me just tell you. When you talk about healing, I think that I ve developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community. I think you can see that.  And I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion And I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate. First of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama. You treated him with terrible disrespect.  And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are. It doesn t work that way. You were after him. Now, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father s company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country   it was a federal lawsuit   were sued. We settled the suit with zero   with no admission of guilt. It was very easy to do. And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don t do on you. Maybe I m trying to save the money. But, frankly, I look   I look at that, and I say, isn t that amazing? Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and it s just one of those things. I ll go one step further. In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it. No discrimination against African- Americans, against Muslims, against anybody. And it s a tremendously successful club. And I m so glad I did it. And I have been given great credit for what I did. And I m very, very proud of it. And that s the way I feel. That is the true way I feel. In addition, I was just endorsed by ICE. They ve never endorsed anybody before on immigration. I was just endorsed by ICE. As far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said. We should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we re not. I don t think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC. She s saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don t   maybe it was. I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK? Now, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we don t know, because the truth is, under President Obama we ve lost control of things that we used to have control over. We came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they re beating us at our own game. ISIS. So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. It is   it is a huge problem. I have a son. He s 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers, it s unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe it s hardly doable. But I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing. But that s true throughout our whole governmental society. We have so many things that we have to do better and certainly cyber is one of them. So she talks about taking them out. She s been doing it a long time. She s been trying to take them out for a long time. But they wouldn t have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that. And then you wouldn t have had them.  (speaking about the creation of ISIS) Or, as I ve been saying for a long time, and I think you ll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil   and we should have taken the oil   ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income. And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil   a lot of the oil in Libya. Wrong  Wrong.  Wrong. The secretary said very strongly about working with   we ve been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyone s ever seen. But you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, that s another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly. They were choking on the sanctions. And now they re going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way they re going. Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren t paying their fair share. Number two   and that bothers me, because we should be asking   we re defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they re supposed to be paying by treaty and contract. And, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because   and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest   but I said, they do not focus on terror. And I was very strong. And I said it numerous times. And about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division. And I think that s great. And I think we should get   because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO. It s a lot of money to protect other people. But I m all for NATO. But I said they have to focus on terror, also.  And they re going to do that. And that was   believe me   I m sure I m not going to get credit for it   but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO. And believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops. Not only that, you named the day. They couldn t believe it. They sat back probably and said, I can t believe it. But you were there, and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant. Now it s in over 30 countries. And you re going to stop them? I don t think so. That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her, because she   frankly, I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media. Well, I have much better judgment than she does. There s no question about that. I also have a much better temperament than she has, you know? I have a much better   she spent   let me tell you   she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising   you know, they get Madison Avenue into a room, they put names   oh, temperament, let s go after   I think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is my temperament. I have a winning temperament. I know how to win. She does not have a Wait. The AFL-CIO the other day, behind the blue screen, I don t know who you were talking to, Secretary Clinton, but you were totally out of control. I said, there s a person with a temperament that s got a problem. Wrong  It s lies That line s getting a little bit old, I must say. I would like to It s not an accurate one at all. It s not an accurate one. So I just want to give a lot of things   and just to respond. I agree with her on one thing. The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your   your president thinks.  Nuclear is the single greatest threat. Just to go down the list, we defend Japan, we defend Germany, we defend South Korea, we defend Saudi Arabia, we defend countries. They do not pay us. But they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service and we re losing a fortune. That s why we re losing   we re losing   we lose on everything. I say, who makes these   we lose on everything. All I said, that it s very possible that if they don t pay a fair share, because this isn t 40 years ago where we could do what we re doing. We can t defend Japan, a behemoth, selling us cars by the million. All I said was, they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out. We re a country that owes $20 trillion. They have to help us out. Well, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, she s very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries. But Russia has been expanding their   they have a much newer capability than we do. We have not been updating from the new standpoint. We are not   we are not keeping up with other countries. I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it. But I would certainly not do first strike. I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it s over. At the same time, we have to be prepared. I can t take anything off the table. Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we re doing nothing there. China should solve that problem for us. China should go into North Korea. China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea. Why didn t you add other things into the deal? One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash. Nobody s ever seen that before. That turned out to be wrong. It was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages. It certainly looks that way.  So you say to yourself, why didn t they make the right deal? This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history. And they re going to end up getting nuclear. I met with Bibi Netanyahu the other day. Believe me, he s not a happy camper. But I will tell you that Hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat ISIS, which she could have defeated by never having it, you know, get going in the first place. Right now, it s getting tougher and tougher to defeat them, because they re in more and more places, more and more states, more and more nations. And she doesn t say that, because she s got no business ability. We need heart. We need a lot of things. But you have to have some basic ability. And sadly, she doesn t have that. All you have to do is speak to them. Wait. You have so many different things you have to be able to do, and I don t believe that Hillary has the stamina. The world   let me tell you. Let me tell you. Hillary has experience, but it s bad experience. We have made so many bad deals during the last   so she s got experience, that I agree.  But it s bad, bad experience. I never said that  I didn t say that  Where did you find this?  Oh, really? You know, Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials. Some of it s said in entertainment. Some of it s said   somebody who s been very vicious to me, Rosie O Donnell, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her. But you want to know the truth?  I was going to say something extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself,  I can t do it. I just can t do it. It s inappropriate. It s not nice. Wow. In hindsight, it would have probably been easier to list the things Trump said that weren t completely and utterly ridiculous. When it finally came time to face off with Hillary Clinton on the debate stage, Trump failed miserably and totally embarrassed himself. As Hillary said Monday night, Donald  lives in his own reality,  presumably a reality where he thinks he actually makes sense.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images"
WHY OBAMA IGNORED MURDER BY ILLEGAL ALIEN IN SANCTUARY CITY: You Have Never Seen Megyn Kelly This Mad Before!,"Fox News host Megyn Kelly shut down a liberal guest in a blistering Thursday night exchange about President Barack Obama s silence on the senseless killing of Kate Steinle at a San Francisco tourist area.Kelly observed that the president was only too willing to speak out on the Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and Freddie Gray killings, but was noticeably silent on Steinle, who was killed by an illegal immigrant who d been deported five times and had seven felony convictions. When asked repeatedly this week to speak to this case, White House spokesman Josh Earnest declined to weigh in, other than to refer folks to the Department of Homeland Security,  Kelly said.  A stark contrast to what we saw after Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson [Missouri], a man we now know was attacking a police officer at the time of his death. Liberal talk show host Richard Fowler made the ridiculous claim that the woman would be alive today if Congress had passed immigration reform legislation. Stop that! Stop that! Stop that! Answer my question please,  Kelly said.  Give an answer! You can t!   There s no excuse for it! He picks and chooses the victims he wants to highlight. And apparently, this victim wasn t deemed worthy. When political consultant Marc Thiessen asked Fowler to explain his statement that Obama doesn t support sanctuary cities for illegal immigrants, Fowler veered off into left field and again brought up lack of immigration reform, placing the blame on Republican lawmakers for not acting on immigration reform. That s a dodge! Support what you just said, Richard!  Kelly shot back.  Stop it   You keep making these assertions and then you dance off to the sidelines. You said the president doesn t support sanctuary city policies. What do you base that on? I base it on the fact that if we had comprehensive immigration reform there would be no need for sanctuary cities,  Fowler repeated.  And I m pretty sure the White House would tell you the same thing tonight. Via: Breitbart News"
NFL LEGEND Who Supported Hillary Leaves CNN Host Speechless Over Praise For Trump…People Who “called him names when he won”…”He reached back and brought them along with him. He held no grudges”[VIDEO]," I fell in love with him [Trump] because he really talks about helping African-American black people, and that s why I m here. Gotta give the man his due. Donald Trump may be the only person alive equally capable of charming Kanye West, Jim Brown, and Mitt Romney. However you may feel about his shtick on the stump, the guy must have a genius-level quotient of personal charisma in private conversation when he feels like summoning it. I wonder how it ll translate in diplomatic meetings, with leaders from other cultures. It s hard to imagine Trump and Merkel hitting it off in the same way it s hard to imagine Merkel hitting it off with, say, Don King, but nothing would surprise me anymore. Brown sounds like he s ready to sign up for the reelection campaign here.  HA When he goes through what he went through to become the President, he s got my admiration. Because no one game him a chance. You know they called him names. Ahh people that called him names when he won, he reached back and brought them along with him. He held no grudges. "
Hillary Clinton Is Asked The Difference Between A Socialist and A Democrat [Video],Awkward! I am a progressive  
" Democrats Introduce Legislation To Probe Russian Voting Hacks, Trump PISSED","It s no secret that Donald Trump got a lot of help from the Russian government this election. From the wildfire of fake news spread across the internet to leaks on Hillary Clinton, Russia and its dear leader Vladimir Putin were in the bag for the new president-elect.But there s proof that the Kremlin and its band of thugs may have acted in a more nefarious, intricate way   and Democrats want to expose that.House Democrats, led by ranking member Adam Schiff (California) of the Committee on Intelligence, are set to introduce legislation that calls for a federal probe into whether or not   and to what extent   the Russian government played in the U.S. election via hacking,  to take action on evidence of foreign interference in the 2016 U.S. elections.  California Rep. Eric Swalwell and Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings will introduce the bill in the lame duck sessionIn a letter to the White House, Schiff asked that President Obama share with members of Congress a classified report that details Russia s potential role in swaying the outcome of the election   and that it very well could have given us President Trump:We are deeply concerned by Russian efforts to undermine, interfere with and even influence the outcome of our recent election. By eroding Americans  and foreigners  trust in US institutions, Russia both weakens our country and sows global instability and uncertainty.The letter, signed by all six Democrats on the committee, comes days after Senate Democrats sent the White House a similar letter urging transparency on Russia.In Time magazine, Donald Trump told interviewers that he does not believe Russia had instigated a hack (or any other meddling) and that the concern of such was politically motivated by the Democrats: I don t believe it. I don t believe they interfered,  Trump said in an interview with Time magazine, which named him person of the year.When asked by Time if the conclusion reached by U.S. officials was motivated by politics, Trump responded,  I think so. While it s unclear how much of an impact the intrusions had on the election outcome, the revelations proved embarrassing for the Democratic Party and cost DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz her job at the top of the committee.Instead, Trump famously blamed any hacking and counter-election offenses by a 400 pound guy in a basement somewhere in the United States (without providing evidence).While Trump peddles conspiracy theories, Democrats seek to legitimize the electoral process of the United States.Featured image via Winn McNamee/Getty Images"
BERNIE SUES To Allow 17 Year Olds To Vote,"Next up is a law suit to make it legal for H-1B Visa holders, felons and illegal aliens to vote in every state. You didn t think the Democrats were trying to protect illegals and grant dangerous criminals an early release because they cared about them, did you? Bernie Sanders s campaign has filed a lawsuit against Ohio s secretary of state to allow 17-year olds to vote in the Democratic primary on March 15, according to a CNN report.Sanders s campaign manager told reporters in Michigan on Tuesday that Republican Jon Husted, who is Ohio s secretary of State, has changed the rules to make it so that those who are currently 17, but will be 18 by the time of the November general election, cannot vote in the state s primaries. The secretary of state has decided to disenfranchise people who are 17 but will be 18 by the day of the general election,  Weaver said, according to CNN.  Those people have been allowed to vote under the law of Ohio, but the secretary of state of the state of Ohio has decided to disenfranchise those people to forbid them from voting in the primary that is coming up on March 15. Sanders has galvanized the support of many young liberal voters, and routinely thumps Democratic rival Hillary Clinton among voters under the age of 40. Clinton generally dominates Sanders among older voters.[quote_box_center]After eight years of Obama, who delivered the same false message of  hope  via free sh*t to America s youth, Bernie Sanders supporters are ready to cast their vote for another lying politician who is promising them a utopia that s impossible to deliver. [/quote_box_center]Millenials are struggling with an immense burden of student debt   debt that rose 25% between 2008 and 2012 alone (the Obama years) even as the economy struggled. According to one 2014 calculation, millennials make up about 40% of the ranks of the unemployed; when they have jobs, they may be underemployed (Starbucks barista, anyone?) or underpaid, or competing ruthlessly for a handful of lucrative opportunities. Some studies suggest that while they might be frugal, their financial situations (coupled, sometimes, with a dearth of financial literacy) can spell trouble.One Pricewaterhouse Coopers survey found 24% of millennial respondents were familiar with basic financial concepts; 30% routinely overdrew their checking accounts (racking up banking fees) and more than 20% ended up dipping into their retirement savings (incurring fees and penalties). Nearly half couldn t come up with $2,000 in the next month in an emergency, making them  financially fragile .The last president elected with a platform of hope and change largely failed to deliver, in their eyes. Oh, and his administration included Hillary Clinton.The issue [of allowing 17 year olds to vote] came to light after a report in the Columbus Dispatch, in which a state Democratic lawmaker accused Husted of changing the rules to keep those who will be 18 by Nov. 4 from voting in the presidential primary.Husted called those accusations and the Sanders lawsuit baseless in a statement released over Twitter, saying that Ohio is operating under the same set of rules it has used in past primaries.Husted s response to Sanders  ridiculous lawsuit can be found here:Some facts about voting for 17-year-olds   they can vote in the primary on nominations, not on delegates or issues. pic.twitter.com/i7pe7Eg6Wl  Jon Husted (@JonHusted) March 8, 2016Via: The Hill"
"WOW! CHICAGO REPORTEDLY FINDS At Least 14,000 More Votes Than Voters In 2016 Election","The head of the Chicago Republican Party is claiming the city reported thousands of more votes cast than voters in the 2016 election   sparking a battle with Chicago officials who call the allegations overblown.First reported by the Chicago City Wire, the Chicago GOP filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the Chicago Board of Elections in January for a list of voters who had cast ballots in November. According to the party, the board responded with a list of 1,101,178 individuals, though its website reflects 1,115,664 votes cast. There should never be more votes than voters every ballot cast should be recorded against a registered voter,  Chairman of the Chicago GOP Chris Cleveland told Fox News, explaining that after receiving the data, the party  immediately  contacted the board for  clarification.   This is either massive fraud or massive incompetence, but we have no way of telling the difference because they won t give us the data. The discrepancy totals more than 14,000, though Cleveland claims it could be as high as 16,000.Cleveland told Fox News he filed a number of FOIA requests the original in January, and  several follow ups  for updated numbers. They ignored them,  Cleveland said.  They have been stonewalling us for six months.

Kellyanne Conway SHUTS DOWN ABC News Hack George Stephanopoulos After He Tries To Convince Viewers Trump Isn’t Legitimate President [VIDEO],"Talking to The Hollywood Reporter, Wentworth said that If Trump wins, we ll start looking at real estate in Sydney, Australia. No crime, no guns. The couple s plans pour further scorn over Stephanopoulos s supposed  objectivity  given his role as a prominent interviewer for ABC, having interviewed Donald Trump twice over the election cycle.  BreitbartNotice how ABC starts out the interview between Stephanopoulos and Conway by flashing a screen shot of Hillary s popular vote numbers compared to Trump s when they have nothing to do with the context of the conversation. This is called subliminal messaging, proving the mainstream media has mastered the art of manipulation. Watch the interview here. Stephanopoulos and his wife s connections to Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party are well documented, with Stephanopoulos having previously worked as an adviser to Bill Clinton and the couple also having donated over $75,000 to the Clinton Foundation.Trump himself pointed out Stephanopoulos s ties to the Clinton Foundation in their most recent interview. On the subject of his regrets, he admitted he had many but added that Stephanopoulos should regret donating to the foundation.These mainstream media hacks who have been given a pass by Republicans for decades are finding themselves in the very difficult position of having to defend themselves against their obvious biases: "
TAKE OUR POLL: Who Do You Think President Trump Should Pick To Replace James Comey?, 
 Senator Asks DOJ To Step In After White Supremacists Vow To Engage In Poll Watching,"A senator from Pennsylvania is asking the Department of Justice to step in following widespread media reports of white supremacists who have vowed to engage in poll watching on election day to guard against voter fraud.Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) wrote a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch, pleading for the DOJ to intervene. These plans to monitor the polls are little more than thinly veiled attempts to suppress and delegitimize the votes of predominantly minority citizens, inflected with innuendo that recalls dark times in our country s civil rights struggle,  Casey wrote.  These calls are more than wrong and irresponsible; if executed, they could be illegal. It has been reported that the National Socialist Movement elements of the Ku Klux Klan and the American Freedom Party are planning to send members to polls in Philadelphia, and elsewhere across the country. Their goal is to ensure that Donald Trump isn t cheated out of the presidency due to voter fraud and a  rigged  election.One alt-right website is even claiming that white supremacists will be handing out liquor and marijuana in the  ghetto  of Philadelphia to help make sure minorities don t make it to the polls to cast their ballots. It has also been reported that hidden cameras will be installed throughout the city to help monitor activities.Casey told the DOJ that appalling tactics such as these must not be permitted under any circumstances. We have come too far to allow a group of white nationalists to intimidate minority voters in Philadelphia or anywhere throughout the nation,  he wrote.Trump has worked his bigoted base into a frenzy over claims that the election is  rigged.  (It s not.) He has convinced his supporters that  voter fraud  is a viable threat, when in fact, it is virtually nonexistent. These poll watching activities aren t even remotely intended to protect our system of fair elections. The only purpose for white supremacists to come out in droves to guard the polls with guns is to intimidate minorities and prevent them from voting.Featured image via John Moore/Getty Images"
 Joe Biden Told A Joke To President Obama About Ted Cruz That Will Have You On The Floor (VIDEO),"Ted Cruz isn t the most likeable guy out there   you ve probably heard this before. And it s not just the media being the media trying to make him look bad   there s a reason Senator Cruz has virtually no endorsements from any of his fellow senators in Congress. It s because the accusations are true; not that many people like the guy, plain and simple.That being said, Vice President Joe Biden made everyone s night (at Ted Cruz s expense) at the Annual Gridiron Dinner on Saturday when he capitalized on this sentiment by telling the crowd a joke he told to President Obama behind closed doors: Ted Cruz? An inspiration to every kid in America who worries that he ll never be able to run for President because nobody likes him.I told Barack, if you really, really want to remake the Supreme Court, nominate Cruz. Before you know it, you ll have eight vacancies. That s not the only joke the vice president made, but is probably the most memorable. The event, held in Washington D.C. is a place where the press and politicians come together every year and, basically, just roast each other. It s supposed to be in good fun   in much the same way you re used to at the annual White House Correspondents Dinner.Biden also took a few jabs at Trump, as well. One made fun of former Speaker of the House John Boehner s fake (orange looking) tan: Donald has attacked every person of color   except John Boehner. Chris Christie (if you ve been keeping up with the news) has been getting some serious flak for the way he looked standing behind Donald Trump during a press conference last week, so Biden joked about that, as well. Chris Christie swears he wasn t being held captive by Trump, but just take a look at that FACE (in the video below). But folks, on a serious point, Trump said he likes  people who don t get captured. What a terrible thing to say about my friend and a genuine war hero, John McCain. So tonight I call on Donald Trump to be a man of his word   and release Chris Christie right now. Vice-President Biden is a man known for saying what s on his mind. Sometimes he gets in trouble for it but most of the time he just makes us laugh. That joke about Ted Cruz was a good one.Featured image via Wikimedia."
WILL OBAMA REGIME Be Held Accountable For Dirty Tactics They Used To Take Down MICHAEL FLYNN?,"While we re on the subject of lying to the FBI, when will Hillary Clinton be prosecuted for multiple crimes she committed while acting as our Secretary of State?  Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn admitted Friday to making false statements to the FBI, entering the first guilty plea in Special Counsel Robert Mueller s Russia probe   and agreeing to cooperate with investigators.A source close to Flynn said financial and emotional pressure helped lead to the decision to plead guilty, rather than endure a drawn-out court battle.As part of the deal, Flynn already is supplying information about the actions of top Trump transition officials.Though the individuals are not named, court documents show Flynn claiming a  very senior member  of the Trump transition team directed him to contact foreign governments including Russia over a United Nations vote   discussions tied to one of Flynn s false statements.The documents also say Flynn called an unnamed senior transition official in December to ask what to communicate to the Russian ambassador about sanctions. That official and Flynn discussed how they didn t want Russia to  escalate the situation,  something Flynn immediately told the ambassador in a phone call.According to the plea deal, Flynn has agreed to  cooperate fully, truthfully, completely and forthrightly  with the probe, with sentencing delayed until those efforts  have been completed. Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, becomes the first Trump ex-White House official charged in the special counsel probe.His tenure at the White House was brief   he was fired for similar conduct, pertaining to his undisclosed discussions with the Russians   and Flynn had been under investigation even before the special counsel probe over lobbying work for Turkey and other issues. The fact that he faced just one count prompted immediate speculation Friday that Flynn was cooperating and offering information to Mueller s team.As for the past discussions between Flynn and transition officials, it s unclear which senior officials the plea deal referred to. But a former senior intelligence officer with knowledge of Trump transition activities told Fox News that then-President-Elect Trump directed Flynn during that period to contact the Russians   while also directing him and his team to contact 12 other countries. The transition team felt that the Obama White House had completely abandoned any coherent foreign policy and had to fill the vacuum,  the former official told Fox News.In a statement, White House lawyer Ty Cobb said  nothing  about the plea implicates anyone other than Flynn. NBC News tweeted Cobb s statement:Today, Michael Flynn, a former National Security Advisor at the White House for 25 days during the Trump Administration, and a former Obama administration official, entered a guilty plea to a single count of making a false statement to the FBI. The false statements involved mirror the false statements to White House officials which resulted in his resignation in February of this year. Nothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr. Flynn. The conclusion of this phase of the Special Counsel s work demonstrates again that the Special Counsel is moving with all deliberate speed and clears the way for a prompt and reasonable conclusion.

Jack Posobiec   (@JackPosobiec) December 1, 2017Watch Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton and ACLJ President Jay Sekulow lay out the case against Barack Obama officials and the felonies they committed when they leaked and improperly disseminate classified information and unmask members of the Trump transition team. Jay Sekulow explains to Sean Hannity, that,  The concern is the intelligence apparatus in the United States has rules, that they have to follow, like every other agency, and it appears that in the waning days, or maybe the last year of the former administration, they viewed those laws as advisory opinions and not law. When the unmasking allegations first surfaced, Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) had plenty to say about the unmasking of Michael Flynn.On March 19, 2017, George Stephanopolis asked Senator Rand Paul about his thoughts on the unmasking of Michael Flynn. Senator Paul suggested that the person responsible for unmasking General Flynn should be in jail. Paul went on to say that you cannot allow this unmasking to take place,  or we will have presidents being blackmailed or national security advisers being blackmailed. Here s an excerpt from their conversation published by Politico:STEPHANOPOULOS: Finally, sir, you re also a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. WE see the president standing by that claim about President Obama. It s caused a rift now with British intelligence over the weekend. How big a problem is this for the president s credibility? How does he fix it?PAUL: I think that we know one thing for sure, that the Obama administration did spy on Flynn. Now, whether it was direct or indirect, somebody was reading and taking   a transcript of his phone calls and then they released it.It is very, very important that whoever released that go to jail, because you cannot have members of the intelligence community listening to the most private and highly classified information and then releasing that to The New York Times.There can only be a certain handful of people who did that. I would bring them all in. They would have to take lie detector tests. And I would say, including the political people, because some political people knew about this as well.But we need to get to the bottom of who is releasing these highly classified conversations. And if the president was surveilled, he probably wasn t the target. I don t know that he was or wasn t. But if he was, they probably targeted someone in a foreign government, but then they listened to the conversation with Americans.STEPHANOPOULOS; You don t believe President Obama ordered an illegal wiretap of President Trump?PAUL: Well, what happens is it s different than that. We target foreigners all the time, but they talk to Americans. They talk to the president. They talk to the national security advisers. And they re supposed to be masked.But there was something alarming the other day. General Hayden admitted that people all the way down to some of the lowest analysts can unmask who the American is. So, someone unmasked General Flynn and they re a low-level analyst, we need to be looking at their computer and find out if they unmasked that conversation and if they spoke with The New York Times you have got to put those people in jail, because you cannot allow this to happen, or we will have presidents being blackmailed or national security advisers being blackmailed.This is a huge, huge problem, bigger than anything else that s being discussed is the fact that private conversations from the intelligence community s perspective are being leaked to the press. That s not like a leak that says, oh, the president watches TV in his bathrobe, this is important to national security, you can t let it happen.Rand Paul was asked again about the unmasking of Michael Flynn on MSNBC s Morning Joe show. Paul told the leftist hosts backdoor searches are illegal and that they could be politicized. Paul said that Susan Rice should be placed under subpoena and she should be asked:  Did you talk to the President about this and did President Obama know about this?    Paul went on to say that the Susan Rice  unmasking  was a witch hunt started by the Obama administration because of sour grapes on the way  out the door. Watch, starting at the 6:30 mark:"
 Heroin Addict Trump Voter Sad Now That Donald Is Taking Away His Treatments (VIDEO),"Pennsylvania resident Kurt Farmer was perfectly fine with building a wall to keep brown people out of the country, banning Muslims from entering the United States, and Donald Trump s other horrifying policies, but he (like the Ku Klux Klan and other hate groups who backed Trump during the election) also made the mistake of believing that The Donald had his interests as a white man at heart.Unfortunately, as a recovering heroin addict, Farmer is now suffering quite a bit of buyer s remorse after learning that his treatments are going to go bye-bye under Trump. Farmer relies on Medicaid to pay for his recovery treatments, and Trump is currently in the process of trying to gut healthcare for all those dirty poors in the country who act like the Constitution guarantees the right to  life  or something. If I didn t have Medicaid, I wouldn t be able to pay for this,  Farmer told CNN.  I would like to say I wouldn t relapse but the chances are from past experience, if I m not going to treatment, in a matter of a few weeks I start getting high. Farmer recently learned   like the rest of us   that the White House intends to allow states to opt out of the Essential Health Benefits regulations under Obamacare   the very same ones that force private insurers and Medicaid to pay for substance abuse recovery.Farmer is the most recent in Trump voters who have lost the faith   but only after learning that they would be hurt by his policies just as much as immigrants, Muslims, and others Trump and his supporters view as Untermensch.This is the difference between conservatives and the rest of us: While we realized The Donald is bad for America as a whole, they waited until he was bad for them to care.Watch the CNN segment below:Featured image via screengrab"
HOLY BETRAYAL OF AMERICA’S NATIONAL SECURITY: New Evidence Shows Hillary Emailed “Most Secretive” Classified Material On Private Unsecured Server,"She s the most dangerous, self-centered woman in America Hillary for Prison 2016.  Hillary Clinton s emails on her unsecured, homebrew server contained intelligence from the U.S. government s most secretive and highly classified programs, according to an unclassified letter from a top inspector general to senior lawmakers.Fox News exclusively obtained the unclassified letter, sent Jan. 14 from Intelligence Community Inspector General I. Charles McCullough III. It laid out the findings of a recent comprehensive review by intelligence agencies that identified  several dozen  additional classified emails   including specific intelligence known as  special access programs  (SAP).That indicates a level of classification beyond even  top secret,  the label previously given to two emails found on her server, and brings even more scrutiny to the presidential candidate s handling of the government s closely held secrets. To date, I have received two sworn declarations from one [intelligence community] element. These declarations cover several dozen emails containing classified information determined by the IC element to be at the confidential, secret, and top secret/sap levels,  said the IG letter to lawmakers with oversight of the intelligence community and State Department.  According to the declarant, these documents contain information derived from classified IC element sources. Intelligence from a  special access program,  or SAP, is even more sensitive than that designated as  top secret    as were two emails identified last summer in a random sample pulled from Clinton s private server she used as secretary of state. Access to a SAP is restricted to those with a  need-to-know  because exposure of the intelligence would likely reveal the source, putting a method of intelligence collection   or a human asset   at risk. Currently, some 1,340 emails designated  classified  have been found on Clinton s server, though the Democratic presidential candidate insists the information was not classified at the time. There is absolutely no way that one could not recognize SAP material,  a former senior law enforcement with decades of experience investigating violations of SAP procedures told Fox News.  It is the most sensitive of the sensitive. Executive Order 13526   called  Classified National Security Information  and signed Dec. 29, 2009   sets out the legal framework for establishing special access programs. The order says the programs can only be authorized by the president,  the Secretaries of State, Defense, Energy, and Homeland Security, the Attorney General, and the Director of National Intelligence, or the principal deputy of each. The programs are created when  the vulnerability of, or threat to, specific information is exceptional,  and  the number of persons who ordinarily will have access will be reasonably small and commensurate with the objective of providing enhanced protection for the information involved,  it states.According to court documents, former CIA Director David Petraeus was prosecuted for sharing intelligence from special access programs with his biographer and mistress Paula Broadwell. At the heart of his prosecution was a non-disclosure agreement where Petraeus agreed to protect these closely held government programs, with the understanding  unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized retention or negligent handling   could cause irreparable injury to the United States or be used to advantage by a foreign nation.  Clinton signed an identical non-disclosure agreement Jan. 22, 2009.While the State Department and Clinton campaign have said the emails in questions were  retroactively classified  or  upgraded    to justify the more than 1,300 classified emails on her server   those terms are meaningless under federal law.The former federal law enforcement official said the finding in the January IG letter represents a potential violation of USC 18 Section 793,  gross negligence  in the handling of secure information under the Espionage Act.

MUST SEE RESULTS OF NEW POLL Asking Americans One Word They Associate With Hillary,"Somehow we don t think this is what the Queen of the Clinton Crime Syndicate expected at this stage of her campaign The latest Q-poll numbers have dropped and there aren t really a lot of surprises in the top lines. (Well  there are a couple of exceptions but we ll get to those in a minute.) What was really startling, though, was the results of the  open ended  questions about several of the candidates. Most specifically, the massively leading, top of the list responses for Hillary Clinton have to be giving her team nightmares. (Connecticut Post  emphasis added)Clinton leads the Democratic field with 45 percent, down from 55 percent July 30, with U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at 22 percent and Biden at 18 percent. No other candidate tops 1 percent with 11 percent undecided. This is Sanders  highest tally and closest margin.Clinton tops the Democrats   no way  list with 11 percent. Liar  is the first word that comes to mind more than others in an open-ended question when voters think of Clinton.  Arrogant  is the word for Trump and voters say  Bush  when they think of Bush. Here s the high end of the list.Holy cow. You get 394 responses just by combining the top three results of  Liar, Dishonest and Untrustworthy.  You pretty much have to add up all of the other words on the list to catch up with those three. And this isn t just a list of responses by Republicans  that s everyone. What s truly amazing is that this is clearly the prevailing American perception at this point and yet, Clinton is still the Democrat frontrunner. I m not sure if that says more about her or the party. Via: HotAir "
HERE’S WHAT Feminists Left Behind After Their Day-Long Hissy Fit…Clearly They’re Not Too Worried About The Environment, 
JUST IN: DALLAS COWBOYS OWNER Jerry Jones Is Leading Effort To Oust NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell,"Make no mistake about it, the NFL needs to show their fans that their players are serious about playing football, or the owners are going to continue to face catastrophic financial losses. The owners didn t hire Goodell to be their social justice director Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones led a conference call with 17 NFL owners on Thursday to discuss the possibility of halting commissioner Roger Goodell s pending contract extension.The owners on Thursday s conference call are unhappy with Goodell and the NFL s front office for a variety of reasons, including the player protests staged during the national anthem, issues regarding the relocation of teams to Los Angeles and the league s handling of the Ray Rice domestic violence case, sources told ESPN. You don t get to have this many messes over the years like Roger has had and survive it,  one owner said during the call.Sources have previously said that Jones has tried to stand in the way of any extension for Goodell.Last month, ESPN reported that Jones was impeding the progress of contract negotiations aimed at an extension for Goodell.  If not for Jerry,  one owner said last month in regard to the contract negotiations,  this deal would be done. The tension between Jones and Goodell is in part credited to the commissioner giving Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott a six-game suspension, which is currently being disputed in court.Another factor in the frustration with Goodell is the controversy surrounding players kneeling during the national anthem.Goodell won t mandate the players stand while Jones is threatening Cowboys onto their feet.Earlier this month, Jones said that any of his players who  disrespect  the flag won t be allowed to play. I know this, we cannot in the NFL in any way give the implication that we tolerate disrespecting the flag,  Jones, also the team s general manager, said after a 35-31 loss to the Green Bay Packers on October 8.The previous week, Jones knelt along with head coach Jason Garrett and all their players in the middle of the field on September 26 in a show of unity before they all stood for the anthem before their 28-17 win over the Arizona Cardinals. Spoke to Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys yesterday. Jerry is a winner who knows how to get things done. Players will stand for Country!  President Trump tweeted.On the other side of the debate, Goodell strongly backed the players and criticized Trump for  an unfortunate lack of respect for the NFL. For entire story- Daily Mail "
BREAKING DISCOVERY: CLINTON FOUNDATION SHARED EMAIL SERVER LOCATION WITH HILLARY’S SECRET SERVER,"The news gets worse every day for the Clinton Crime Syndicate Breitbart News Exclusive: Hillary Clinton s private email server was housed at the same physical location and on the same network as an email server used and operated by the Clinton Foundation, Breitbart News has exclusively learned.Records reveal that Hillary Clinton s private clintonemail.com server shared an IP address with her husband Bill Clinton s email server, presidentclinton.com, and both servers were housed in New York City, not in the basement of the Clintons  Chappaqua, New York home.Web archives show that the Presidentclinton.com Web address was being operated by the Clinton Foundation as of 2009, when Hillary Clinton registered her own clintonemail.com server.Numerous Clinton Foundation employees used the presidentclinton.com server for their own email addresses, which means that they were using email accounts that, if hacked, would have given any hacker complete access to Hillary Clinton s State Department emails, as well.The bombshell revelation raises new concerns about the possible illegality of Hillary Clinton s private email use. The former Secretary of State is under federal investigation for potentially violating the Espionage Act by allowing people without a security clearance to access classified information. The fact that Hillary was sharing an email network with a private foundation means that people without a security clearance almost certainly had physical access to her server while she was working at the State Department.Here s what we know:The Servers Have The SAME IP AddressHillary s clintonemail.com server and the Foundation-run presidentclinton.com email server have exactly the same IP address, and the same SSL certificate (which an organization purchases for an email server to verify its trustworthiness).mail.clintonemail.com and mail.presidentclinton.com both have an IP address of 64.94.172.146, according to an SSL Certificate Checker.The two servers both have that same IP address, 64.94.172.146, according to DNS records. (Here are records for Hillary s server, and here are records for Bill s server).Both servers have the same IP address, according to another independent Internet records database, robtex.net.The fact that both of these email servers have the same IP address means that they were operating on the same network, and sharing physical space. A computer expert tells Breitbart News that the servers were probably operating on the same machine. It is also possible that they were operating on different machines on the same network, which still means that the machines would have to be close enough to exist in the same physical location.President Clinton s server was created in 2002, while Hillary s was created in 2009, which means that Hillary s server was simply added to Bill s Foundation-run server network.They Had The SAME IP Address When She Was Secretary of StateHillary s server and Bill s Foundation-run server also shared a different IP address during her tenure as Secretary of State.From September 8, 2009 until June 24, 2011, Bill Clinton s Foundation-run mail.presidentclinton.com server had an IP address of 24.187.234.187, according to DNS records.Hillary s mail.clintonemail.com server had the same exact IP address, 24.187.234.187, from the dates May 21, 2010 until October 21, 2010, according to DNS records.Their Shared IP Address Can Be Traced to Midtown ManhattanA geographical search for the IP address that both servers shared at registration traces to Midtown Manhattan, according to three different databases: infosniper.net, which locates a Midtown latitude/longitude point, ip-tracker.org, which also gives a Midtown latitude/longitude point, and whatsmyip.org.Clinton Foundation headquarters are currently located at 1271 6th Avenue in Midtown. Bill Clinton s office is at 55 West 125th StreetThe Denver-based firm Platte River Networks told Breitbart News that it physically moved Hillary Clinton s private email server out of the basement of her Chappaqua home in 2013. But the Clintons could have moved the server from Manhattan to Chappaqua before Platte River got there.Clinton Founation Employees Had presidentclinton.com email addressesThe employees who have used presidentclinton.com email addresses included former Bill Clinton right-hand man Doug Band, as well as Justin Cooper, a Hillary aide who has worked with the Foundation, Terry Krinvic, Laura Graham, and John Zimmerebner.Was Chelsea Clinton On The Server?The email server for mail.chelseaoffice.com, which is no longer active, resolves to clintonemail.com, according to DNS records. Wikileaks confirms that the chelseaoffice.com server was used by Chelsea Clinton employees.Hillary Even Admitted That She Used Her Husband s  System Well the system we used was set up for President Clintons office and it had numerous safeguards it was on property guarded by the Secret Service and there were no security breaches, so I think that the use of that server which started with my husband proved to be effective and secure,  Hillary Clinton said in a March 2015 press conference.Clinton has not returned to that talking point since.The Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton s campaign did not return requests for comment by press time.

 The NFL Puts Trump In A VERY Awkward Position Over His Whining About The Debate Schedule,"The presidential debate schedule is already out, and, true to form, Donald Trump is already throwing a livid fit about it. He doesn t like the fact that two of the debates are scheduled on the same nights as NFL games, which would be understandable if he wasn t busy saying Hillary Clinton is responsible for that. However, he crossed a major line in his accusations, and it has already come back to bite him hard.In an interview with ABC News, he made the following ridiculous claim: Well, I ll tell you what I don t like. It s against two NFL games. I got a letter from the NFL saying,  This is ridiculous. Why are the debates against   cause the NFL doesn t wanna go against the debates.  Cause the debates are gonna be pretty massive, from what I understand, OK? And I don t think we should be against the NFL. Now, aside from the obvious questions of why the NFL would be sending Trump a letter about this, rather than the Commission on Presidential Debates, it appears that this is one of Trump s most blatant lies yet. CNN s Brian Stetler says the NFL responded by disavowing any contact with Trump at all: While we d obviously wish the debate commission could find another night, we did not send a letter to Trump. And there it is. Most politicians who are given to lies will at least attempt to lie in such a way that it s hard to prove, even with a statement from whomever or whatever they re lying about. Not Trump! No he s so important that it doesn t matter that the debate schedule has been in place for a year already. Agencies like the NFL will communicate to him first, because he s just that crucial to the whole process.Why is this significant? Because it s not a gaffe. A gaffe is when a politician, pundit, or someone else heavily involved in politics accidentally lets loose what s really on their minds. Romney s 47 percent comment four years ago is a gaffe. Trump, however, commits gaffes and also tells outright lies. And because of that, it s virtually pointless to fact-check him, because even with a statement from whoever he s lied about, he ll double down on it.If nothing else, this lie, while seemingly stupid, provides a deep look into the psyche of the man who is Donald Trump. He ll say whatever he wants   he doesn t care. And if the NFL wants to take him down a notch or twelve by denying they even communicated with him, then he ll make sure they re sorry for making him look like the fool that he is. Or he ll ignore them altogether.His fa ade is coming down, and only the truly brainwashed voters, along with the white supremacist masses he s attracted, remain willfully blind to his lack of honesty. The NFL is a major organization. They just made Trump look very bad indeed.Featured image by Regine Mahaux/Getty Images"
"“DRIVE THEM OUT OF YOUR PLACES OF WORSHIP!” London Imams Take President Trump’s Advice, REFUSE To Perform Funeral Rights For Islamic Terrorists [VIDEO]","President Trump gave a powerful speech to Arab leaders at the opening of the new Global Centre for Combatting Extremist Ideology in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on May 21, 2017. In his historic speech, President Trump warned Islamic extremists:  If you choose terror, your life will be brief and your life will be empty.  Trump went on to tell the Arab leaders and the entire world, We are not here to lecture and tell you how to live. We are here to work together to meet one goal and meet history s great test to conquer extremism. Young Muslim boys and girls should be able to grow up free from fear, safe from violence and innocent of hatred. Young Muslims should be able to build prosperity for themselves. This will be the beginning of the end for those who fight terror. This special gathering will one day be remembered as the start of peace in the Middle East and potentially all over the world. Watch the clip of President Trump telling Arab leaders in Riyadh and around the world to  drive out terrorism  from their nations and from their places of worship:It appears that the Imams in London were listening after East London Mosque and London Muslim Centre Chairman Muhammad Habibur-Rahman boldly announced to Muslims everywhere that if they commit acts of terror against innocent people, they will not receive funeral rights in London mosques.British police on Tuesday named the final member of the terror trio that murdered seven people on Saturday in a knife and van attack before police shot the jihadis dead   and the news comes as more than 130 Muslim religious leaders were refusing to say funeral prayers for any members of the ISIS cell.The decision by the Muslim leaders was seen as an  unprecedented  move because the funeral ritual is typically performed on a deceased Muslim no matter the person s past actions. The group of religious leaders have urged others to join them in declining to pray for the dead killers. We, as Muslim imams and religious leaders, condemn the recent terror attacks in Manchester and London in the strongest terms possible,  the Muslim leaders said in a statement.  Coming from a range of backgrounds, and from across the U.K.; feeling the pain the rest of the nation feels, we have come together to express our shock and utter disgust at these cold-blooded murders. We are deeply hurt that a spate of terror attacks have been committed in our country once more by murderers who seek to gain religious legitimacy for their actions. We seek to clarify that their reprehensible actions have neither legitimacy nor our sympathy. East London Mosque and London Muslim Centre Chairman Muhammad Habibur-Rahman said the decision was made because  those who perpetrate terrorism: you are against the very core teaching of Islam and of our Prophet Muhammad. Your misguidance will lead you to destruction, and God willing you will utterly fail in your evil aims,  he said in a statement.The decision underscores a warning President Trump issued to the Islamic world last month. Speaking in Riyadh before the leaders of 50 Muslim majority countries, Trump told warned terrorists that taking innocent lives would not lead to eternal paradise. If you choose the path of terror, your life will be empty, your life will be brief, and your soul will be fully condemned,  Trump said.U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also applauded the move. He said he was encouraged by the imams and said that the decision means  they re condemning their souls  since the funeral prayer asks for forgiveness of the dead. And that is what has to be done,  he said.Youssef Zaghba, a Moroccan-born Italian man, was identified Tuesday morning as the final member of the trio that descended upon the London Bridge on Saturday.Mak Chishty, the Metropolitan police commander of engagement, said, according to The Guardian, that it is time for Muslims to  counter the scourge of terrorism, extremism and hatred that we have in our communities at present. Chishty, the highest-ranking officer in the department of Muslim faith, said,  It is the Islamic duty of every Muslim to be loyal to the country in which they live. We are now asking questions to understand how extremism and hatred has taken hold within some elements of our own communities.   FOX News "
MASSACHUSETTS VOTES TO IGNORE FED LAW and Let Illegals Go…This Sanctuary State Endangers All Americans!,"MASSACHUSETTS IS NOW A SANCTUARY STATE! The Massachusetts Supreme Court just ruled that illegals are to be released and not held under federal law. This puts all Americans at risk! Tucker Carlson previously interviewed a State Rep. who supports subverting federal law. Please listen to the skewed reasoning for not following federal law:In a ruling hailed by civil liberties advocates that ends a longstanding immigration enforcement practice, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court declared Monday that current state law  provides no authority for Massachusetts court officers to arrest and hold an individual solely on the basis of a Federal civil immigration detainer, beyond the time that the individual would otherwise be entitled to be released from State custody. State Representative James Lyons, an Andover Republican, said he is working with Republican Representatives Marc Lombardo of Billerica, and Shaunna O Connell of Taunton to gather co-sponsors on a bill he plans to file Tuesday or Wednesday. Lyons said the bill would be  straightforward,  giving Massachusetts police and court officers the power to arrest someone on a civil immigration warrant.  People are concerned about the rule of law,  Lyons told the News Service. Asked about how he thought the bill would fare in the Democrat-controlled Legislature, Lyons said,  Beacon Hill, I can t predict what s going on up there.  While the high court ruling focused on court officers, advocates said the opinion prohibits any state official from keeping someone jailed solely at the request of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).  Going forward, nobody in Massachusetts should be held on an immigration detainer unless the Legislature were to attempt to change that,  said Emma Winger, Immigration Impact Unit staff attorney for the Committee on Public Counsel Services, who argued the case before the Supreme Judicial Court in April. It applies to anybody with arrest authority,  said Laura Rotolo, staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts. Rotolo said that while many jurisdictions have limited their cooperation with ICE, the SJC is the first state high court to rule against ICE detainers.Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson said the decision will make people more vulnerable to crime in Massachusetts.  I wouldn t say it makes Massachusetts a sanctuary state. I think it makes Massachusetts more vulnerable   the people who live here and people who visit here   more vulnerable to become victims of crime, and also a further message to people throughout the country who are here illegally that we re the place you want to come,  Hodgson said.Read more: New Boston Post"
KELLYANNE CONWAY Slaps Down Rabid CNN Host Chris Cuomo: “Aren’t you the least bit embarrassed that you now talk about Russia more than you talk about America?” [VIDEO],"Chris Cuomo of fake news network CNN interviewed Kellyanne Conway on Sunday. You would have thought by now, these hacks at CNN would have figured out they are no match for the brilliant Kellyanne Conway. At the opening of his interview with Conway, Cuomo attempted to convince the few viewers who still watch CNN that President Trump was  very squishy  on his meeting with Vladimir Putin. Kellyanne Conway snapped back in her usual calm but witty way,  Chris, let s back up. So you re saying you used the word squishy which, itself, is unusual to describe the president s state of mind. So somehow that makes people on CNN insist that the president is never going to raise this with Putin? Why are they still in there?  Cuomo responded,  It s not about CNN. It s about what the president said, Kellyanne.  Kellyanne immediately landed a right hook to fake news host Chris Cuomo when she asked him,  Aren t you the least bit reluctant, if not embarrassed that you now talk about Russia more than you talk about America? Cuomo went on to discuss the nothing-burger story about a meeting Donald Trump Jr. had with a Russian lawyer prior to the election. The lawyer allegedly claimed he had information about individuals connected to Russian that were funding the DNC and Hillary. It turns out she was a human rights lawyer who wanted to talk about adoption. But CNN, who suffers from Trump-Russia collusion obsession, is clinging to this story like a squirrel protects its only nut in the dead of winter. Again, Conway delivered another knock out blow saying,  you keep on saying opposition research the way you guys constantly vomit words like collusion and Russian interference and affecting the election, all of which you have no evidence. We cannot convert wishful thinking into hard evidence. Watch: "

Candidate Handel’s Excellent Response to Alexandria Shooter Calling Her A ‘Republican B**ch’," We should not allow our political differences to escalate to violent attacks. We must all refuse to allow the politics of our country to be defined in this way,  she wrote.  Now more than ever, we must unite as a one nation under God. It is incumbent upon all of us to work together in a civil and productive way, even when we disagree.    Georgia Congressional Candidate Karen HandelPLEASE NOTE THAT HANDEL AND DEMOCRAT JOHN OSOFF ARE IN A BATTLE THAT WILL TAKE PLACE ON JUNE 20TH IN THE 6TH DISTRICT GEORGIA RUNOFF   GET OUT AND VOTE HANDEL!IF YOU WANT TO DONATE TO KAREN HANDEL: DONATE HEREKaren Handel, the Republican candidate for Congress in Georgia s sixth district, on Wednesday afternoon addressed that morning s shooting at a Republican congressional baseball team practice.A gunman who police identified as James T. Hodgkinson opened fire on Republican lawmakers practicing for a charity baseball game in Alexandria, Va., wounding five people including House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R., La.). Hodgkinson had penned a Facebook rant against Handel last week. My thoughts are with the victims of this morning s despicable, unprovoked attack on the Republican congressional softball team,  wrote Handel, Georgia s former secretary of state.  Representative Scalise is a friend, and my heart goes out to him and his family. Steve and I wish him and the others wounded a speedy recovery. They remain in our thoughts and prayers. I also want to commend the heroic actions of the Capitol Police officers who clearly prevented today s attack from being a much bigger tragedy,  she wrote.Handel also addressed expletive comments that Hodgkinson made about her on social media.Hodgkinson posted an article about Handel to his Facebook, calling her a  Republican Bitch  who wants  People to Work for Slave Wages,  NBC affiliate WXIA reported. Republican Bitch Wants People to Work for Slave Wages, when a Livable Wage is the Only Way to Go! Vote Blue, It s Right for You!  Hodgkinson wrote on Facebook. I am aware that the suspect recently made vile comments about me on social media,  Handel said in her statement.  It also appears that the suspect targeted members of Congress specifically because he disagreed with their views. Hodgkinson s social media posts indicate he was a supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) and loathed President Donald Trump and Republican policies.Handel echoed calls by others, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.), for bipartisan unity following the attack. We should not allow our political differences to escalate to violent attacks. We must all refuse to allow the politics of our country to be defined in this way,  she wrote.  Now more than ever, we must unite as a one nation under God. It is incumbent upon all of us to work together in a civil and productive way, even when we disagree. READ MORE: WFB"
 Anti-Porn GOP Florida Lawmaker Was Just Caught Porning On Twitter,"The GOP has a thing for porn. In 2016, Sen. Todd Weiler introduced legislation asking his state to recognize that porn is creating a public health hazard and Republicans thought that was a cool idea. Well, now it s 2017 and a Florida lawmaker who filed a similar proposal was just busted favoriting a porn tweet. You could say he got Ted Cruzed.Just a few days ago, State Rep. Ross Spano filed a bill to declare pornography a public health crisis in Florida, but from his Twitter account, it appears he  liked  a pornographic tweet.According to the Orlando Weekly, the Republican s list of likes on Twitter is typically football clips, Bible verses, and GOP-related content about how evil Islam is. But, nestled into his  likes  list is a tweet from Jan. 8 by the  Goddess Lesbian  Twitter account, which features a video clip from adult entertainment company Reality Kings. On that same day, Spano liked a Biblical quote-tweet from Franklin Graham but we re not sure if that was before or after he was watching lesbians having sexy-time in front of the camera.Screenshot!This wouldn t matter in the least except for the bill Spano filled, HR157, which the Orlando Weekly notes is  incredibly harsh on adult content  and he left that  liked  porn tweet up for nine months. It appears to be deleted now. Franklin Graham s liked tweet is still there, though.The bill, which is contrary to research, states that  recent research indicates that pornography is potentially biologically addictive, resulting in the user consuming increasingly more shocking material to satisfy the addiction,  and adds,  Pornography has a detrimental effect on families and is linked to a reluctance to enter into marriage, dissatisfaction in marriage and marital infidelity. Spano says he didn t do it. It wasn t him being horny on Twitter.Obviously, I have a long social media history on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram since I was first elected in 2012. With a thorough examination of my accounts, it will be easy to see that this is not my doing. I have since gone back, once notified, and rectified the problem. And I m now looking into how it occurred in the first place.In addition, referencing my prior statement, I don t believe any of this takes the focus off of the fact that there is a direct correlation between pornography and a host of societal problems, including human trafficking, exploitation of children, sex slavery, and domestic violence.Sure, it wasn t Spano, it must have been that other Spano guy with the same Twitter account and password. Sounds legit!Image via YouTube screen capture."
HIDDEN CAMERA Shows How Illegal Aliens Steal Jobs From Americans…How They Really Feel About Competing With American Citizens For Jobs [VIDEO],"Liberals have been telling American citizens for decades that  illegal aliens are doing the low-wage jobs Americans won t do. Is that really true?How much do those illegal aliens standing on various street corners make per hour, per week or per year? Do they really pay taxes? Are they helping or harming American citizens who are hoping to find work and become self-sufficient?  How does employing illegal aliens in America affect our economy? How much money does the government take from working American citizens via taxes to provide illegal aliens the opportunity to work and live in America tax free?Comedian and conservative activist Steven Crowder goes undercover in his latest video that answers all of these questions. Crowder joins illegal aliens on a street corner who are looking to be picked up by employers and given a job for the day. Watch the negotiation process and notice how boldly one of the illegal aliens admits to Crowder that he doesn t pay any taxes. The illegal alines are also not so subtle about the way they let Crowder know they don t want any white male US citizens competing for jobs with them.Watch:"
 Bigoted Cops Shove Lesbian Out Of Women’s Bathroom Because She Looks Like A Man (VIDEO),"The hopes and dreams of millions of bigots finally came true when three cops on a power trip confronted a lesbian in a public restroom and shoved her outside. Why? Because they  thought  she was a guy.In a video titled  Lesbian harassed and forced to leave a public restroom because the police insist she s a man, three officers, two males and a female, can be seen in a public women s restroom telling a woman referred to her friends as a  dyke  that she has to leave. This is despite the fact that several of her friends are standing right there telling the cops that she is, in fact, a girl.Now to be fair to the cops, the woman in question didn t have ID and was dressed like a guy because women NEVER do that in America. Completely unheard of. And, even worse, she was fairly flat chested and that s something else that s simply inconceivable. Everyone knows that woman always have curves so you can identify them as chicks. So, clearly, there was absolutely no WAY the cops could know whether or not this was a woman.Other than, you know, the woman and her friends saying that she was. But since when do whiny civilians know better than the police? Frankly, I m surprised they didn t force her to drop her pants to prove it.Here s the disturbing video:This is exactly the kind of prejudice Republicans have been hoping to inspire with their  Bathroom Laws.  They know that people only need the thinnest of justifications to vent their hate and we see here the result. As far as I m concerned, the cops knew damn well that she wasn t a man or they would have arrested her. That they didn t even threaten it tells me that bullying was the intent and nothing else. Again, exactly what Republicans wanted.The right has lost the culture war against the LGBT community and what we re witnessing now is the last desperate attempts by bigots to turn back the clock to  better times.  I hope this woman sues the crap out of the police for violating her civil rights and they all lose their jobs. We have enough power tripping assholes on the streets as it is.Featured image via screencap"
3 MILLION ILLEGAL ALIENS Under Investigation For Voting…After Obama Told Them It Was Ok,"Part of the problem is that organizations are registering people without  any proof they are legal American citizens .Leaked funding documents reveal an effort by George Soros and his foundations to manipulate election laws and process rules ahead of the federal election far more expansively than has been previously reported.The billionaire and convicted felon moved hundreds of millions of dollars into often-secret efforts to change election laws, fuel litigation to attack election integrity measures, push public narratives about voter fraud, and to integrate the political ground game of the left with efforts to scare racial minority groups about voting rights threats.These Soros-funded efforts moved through dozens of 501(c)(3) and (c)(4) charities and involved the active compliance with civil rights groups, government officials, and purportedly non-partisan groups like the League of Women Voters.The leaked documents also reveal deliberate and successful efforts to manipulate media coverage of election issues in mainstream media outlets like the The New York Times.IF YOU LIVE IN ONE OF THE STATES BELOW, PLEASE DEMAND THAT VOTER ID IS ENACTED: Although some states require some form of ID before voting, California, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont, West Virginia, Wyoming, and Washington, D.C. all require no identification before voting.Please contact True the Vote for any and all information regarding voter fraud.

Under Lansing city policy, police don t ask for people s immigration status, except as required by U.S. or Michigan law or a court order.Council members voted 5-2 to reverse last week s 6-0 vote to give the city  sanctuary  status. Immigration advocates in the crowd called called council members  spineless  and said  you re all losing your seats. The dispute comes as several cities are battling President Donald Trump s promised crackdown on places that block cooperation between their police departments and U.S. immigration authorities. The Trump administration has warned that sanctuary cities could lose federal money for refusing to cooperate with immigration authorities.After last week s vote, council members received a letter from the Lansing Regional Chamber and Michigan Chamber of Commerce urging them to remove references to  sanctuary city  from its resolution. Lansing is a diverse community, rich with history and culture. It s what makes our city a welcoming destination to live, work and thrive,  the business groups  letter says.  Recent actions of City Council, whether intended or not, have placed an unnecessary target on the City of Lansing while jeopardizing millions of dollars in federal funding that impacts the city budget. The term  sanctuary  in the resolution has become very problematic and distracting   so distracting in my opinion that s it s taken away from the intent of our resolution, which is to protect individuals,  said Councilwoman Judi Brown Clarke.  It s basically a  don t ask  policy, which was outlined by the mayor s executive order and what we had in our policy complements that. That was already the policy in Lansing before last week s vote, but Lansing called itself a  welcoming city,  rather than a  sanctuary city.  Neither the welcoming city resolution nor the sanctuary city resolution called for Lansing to prohibit workers from providing information on a person s immigration status with U.S. immigration officials   a ban that s at the heart of some urban sanctuary cities disagreements with the Trump administration.The issue also has touched off debate in the Republican-controlled Michigan Legislature, which is considering banning local governments from enacting or enforcing rules that limit communication and cooperation with federal officials concerning people s immigration status. Similar legislation died in the last session.   FOX News"
 Report: Turns Out Most Of Trump’s ‘Charity’ Was Giving Free Golf To His Business Friends,"Given the fact that Donald Trump has often bragged that he intentionally used his numerous bankruptcies as a way to exploit the government (and taxpayers) into paying his debts, it s not exactly surprising to learn that the billionaire business mogul has a spotty track record with philanthropy, but the scope of his greed, revealed in a new deep dive analysis by the Washington Post, is shocking.Trump loves to brag that he has given over $100 million to charity in the past five years, but like nearly everything the Republican frontrunner says, the truth is much different. Trump published a list of 4,844  contributions  he s made, which seems impressive until you actually start to look at what the donations are.As the Washington Post discovered: many of the gifts that Trump cited to prove his generosity were free rounds of golf, given away by his courses for charity auctions and raffles.Trump s campaign also counted a parcel of land that he d given to New York state   although that was in 2006, not within the past five years.The Donald J. Trump Foundation, Trump s biggest charity, was especially notable for its lack of well Trump. Between 2008 and 2014, Trump didn t donate a single penny of his own money to the foundation, instead he leaned on rich friends to give their money and he then sent out the checks to the charities under his name. What a guy.And while some of that money undeniable went to good causes, Trump also used a lot of his  donations  to shore up his political and business interests. The Washington Post again:His foundation, for example, frequently gave money to groups that paid to use Trump s facilities, and it donated to conservatives who could help promote Trump s rise in the Republican Party. The foundation s second-biggest donation described on the campaign s list went to the charity of a man who had settled a lawsuit with one of Trump s golf courses after being denied a hole-in-one prize.Trump s campaign had a truly stunning response when asked to explain why Trump s charitable giving was so weak: They didn t want to make Trump an easy mark for other charities. We want to keep them quiet,  said Weisselberg, who is also treasurer of the Trump Foundation.  He doesn t want other charities to see it. Then it becomes like a feeding frenzy. Amazing. Absolutely amazing.And while Trump certainly isn t the only rich person to horde his money for himself, his friends, and his business interests, it s worth noting that other billionaires have rejected this egregious level of greed and actually given vast amounts of their wealth to real, world-changing causes. Bill Gates, for example, has given $28 billion already and he says he s not done. It wasn t given to give friends free tickets to a game of golf, either. Gates and his wife have spent years fighting to eradicate the scourge of polio off the face of the earth, something he calls  a gift for the rest of time. Likewise, Warren Buffett set a charity record in June 2015   around the time Trump was teasing his presidential run   by donating $2.8 billion in one lump sum.Donald Trump has gotten pretty far in the election by impressing his supporters with his wealth. Many cite his business skills (debatable as they are) as the primary reason they will vote for him. However, is it not just as important to see what he does with the money once he has it? Unlike other people fortunate enough to have billions, it s clear he believes giving away his money to fight disease, poverty, or other social causes is a waste. He s repeatedly taken advantage of his wealth to influence people and get ahead.Somebody might want to pull him aside and let him know that money isn t something you can take with you when you die. He may even thank you for the advice with a free golf pass.Featured image via Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images"
“G#d d*mn America”: DISTURBING PHOTOS Illustrate Obama’s “Diplomacy” Failure In Iran,"Yes this massive protest against America just happened today! Thousands of Iranians burned the American flag and chanted slogans Wednesday as they marked the anniversary of the seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran by militant students 36 years ago.The annual state-organized rally drew greater attention this year, as Iranian hard-liners look to counter moderate President Hassan Rouhani s outreach to the West following a landmark nuclear deal reached with world powers in July. An Iranian official also chose the occasion to announce the arrest of an unspecified number of allegedly pro-American writers.The hard-liners fear Rouhani s efforts to improve relations will pave the way for the United States to undermine and eventually dismantle the Islamic republic formed after the 1979 revolution.On Nov. 4, 1979, militant students stormed the U.S. Embassy compound and took 52 Americans hostage after Washington refused to hand over the toppled U.S.-backed shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, for trial in Iran. The students held the hostages for 444 days, and the two countries have had no diplomatic relations since then.Protesters on Wednesday carried placards reading  political and security penetration is forbidden.  They pumped their fists in the air, shouting  God damn America,  and  No compromise, no surrender to U.S. Others carried banners rejecting U.S. fast food chains McDonald s and Starbucks. Authorities recently closed a newly opened knock-off of KFC, saying it was unlicensed.Hard-liners view fast food outlets and other American products as part of a  cultural invasion  by the U.S. aimed at undermining Islamic rule and public morality.Foreign firms are poised to return to Iran following the lifting of international sanctions under the nuclear deal, but it remains unclear whether American brands will be allowed in.Iran s state TV showed similar demonstrations in other Iranian cities to mark the occasion, known as the  National Day against Global Arrogance. Wednesday s rally in Tehran also saw State Prosecutor Ebrahim Raeisi announce that the intelligence department of the elite Revolutionary Guard had detained a number of writers. The intelligence and security forces identified and cracked down on a network of penetration in media and cyberspace and detained spies and writers hired by Americans,  he told the rally, without elaborating. Under no circumstances will we allow penetration of Americans in economic, social and cultural areas,  he added.Iran has arrested a number of activists, journalists and artists since Rouhani s 2013 election and currently holds four Iranians with U.S. citizenship, including a Washington Post reporter. Analysts say the arrests are the work of hard-liners in the judiciary and the security forces. Via: AP News"

BOOM! CONSUMER CONFIDENCE SOARS To Level Americans Haven’t Seen Since Another Republican Was President…MEDIA SILENT,"Prior to the 2016 election (Oct  16) consumer confidence measured by the University of Michigan was indexed at 87.2 Today that same confidence rating is 101.1 A stunning 15.9% increase. Similarly, consumer expectations were indexing 76.8 in October 2016 and now stand at 91.3, an increase of 18.9%.   Conservative TreehouseBusiness Insider   US consumers haven t been this optimistic about the economy since the start of 2004, according to a survey conducted by the University of Michigan.The consumer-sentiment index registered a preliminary October reading of 101.1, a monthly report showed Friday.The data suggest that consumer spending will likely continue to support the economy through at least mid-2018, at which time this economic expansion would become the second-longest since the 19th century. US economic growth in the second quarter rose to a two-year high on stronger consumer and business spending, a late-September report showed.The surge in optimism  reflects an unmistakable sense among consumers that economic prospects are now about as good as could be expected,  said Richard Curtin, the chief economist of the survey. This  as good as it gets  outlook is supported by a moderation in the expected pace of growth in both personal finances and the overall economy, accompanied by a growing sense that, even with this moderation, it would still mean the continuation of good economic times.

"#BoycottPenzeys: HATEFUL, DIVISIVE Penzeys Spice Co. Owner Threatens Trump Supporters…Brags About Increased Sales Since Calling All Trump Supporters “Racists”","Bill Penzey, the owner of Penzeys Spices, wrote two separate letters on the Penzeys Spices Facebook page, accusing all Trump s voters of openly embracing racism. Isn t it funny how liberals think they can use the most hateful and divisive language against fellow Americans, then excuse their open hate as an act of  love  or unity?  We re asking Trump supporters and anyone who disagrees with a company owner calling half of America racists  to BOYCOTT Penzeys Spices. (List of states where Penzeys Spice stores are located can be found below)Here is an excerpt from his first letter:Please give us a moment to share something we hope you will find very valuable.Our customers come from all walks of life. The kindness of cooks knows no borders or divides. In the aftermath of the election, seeing the intentional damage inflicted on so many outside the white heterosexual male world, we raised our voice. We felt we had to. We did this because we are Penzeys. The Spice business is so intertwined with history that it s not really possible to have one without the other. It became clear to us that we are now in a moment history will long have its eyes upon. For the sake of our customers, and for the sake of future generations, we felt the time had come to stand on the right side of history.And while the reasons for why we took a stand might be specific to our unique outlook, what we learned actually applies to all commerce in the United States. What we learned is that President-elect Donald Trump has no real support. Voters, sure, but no constituency. Running a campaign on  that horrible-terrible-woman who should be locked up,  while at the same time working to raise fear of minorities among white voters with limited access to education, clearly achieved its goal. But none of it left Americans with any sense of connection to the candidate they actually voted for.Willing to take a hit for what is right, we did what we did. In the two weeks since, online sales are up 59.9%, gift box sales up 135%. And we didn t have a catalog arrive in this window this year, while last year we had 1.1 million! Yes, maybe for the moment we have lost 3% of our customers because of the so-called  right wing firestorm.  And, yes, they send emails of rage, and ALL CAPS, and bad language with the hope of creating the perception that they are bigger than they really are. But what we learned is that, in terms of retail spending, Donald Trump simply has no one supporting his views for America. He has no constituency.In this moment there is finally the real chance to unite our nation in our shared rejection of sexism, homophobia, and racism. This is your chance to stand up for America s values and make January a tent pole in your company s history. Opportunities to do the right thing at the time when doing the right thing makes all the difference come once in a lifetime. Make your history proud.For entire letter, see Facebook post below:"

 Tony Perkins: Christians Are Living In ‘Spiritual Ghettos’ Under Left-Wing Rule (VIDEO),"The Family Research Council s hater-in-chief Tony Perkins is joining his fellow deranged right-wing Christians in insisting that left-wingers are slowly but surely about to outlaw Christianity. He appeared on D. James Kennedy Ministries  Truths That Transform show with the Ministry s president, Frank Wright, and ranted on about how the inability of Christians to force their crazy beliefs on the rest of us somehow means they are being persecuted. Perkins told Wright: We are not disqualified from engaging in the public square simple because we re Christian. And that s where we re at today, where people want us to check our Christian faith at the door of even public service; not just holding public office, but if you re a fireman, a policeman, a teacher, a football coach, you re supposed to leave your faith at home or within the confines of the church. [That is] totally contrary to what the founders envisioned and, I would argue, Frank, totally contrary to what God has called us to do. The thing is, though, the idea that you cannot bring your religious beliefs into doing jobs in public office and other parts of the public sector is NOT persecution, Mr. Perkins. It simply means that you cannot force your beliefs on others in the workplace or in the public sector. That s it. Nothing more or less. Further, it is quite ironic that this man is crying foul on this one, considering that his organization s entire purpose is to strip basic civil rights from anyone and everyone who isn t a right-wing Christian, particularly LGBT people. Hypocrite much?Wright, of course, being just as much of a loon as Perkins, took things a step further, suggesting that any day now, the government would be outlawing the practice of Christianity altogether. Of course, Perkins latched on to this one, and said: We see this administration, we see the left creating these spiritual ghettos where we are forced into, confined to these areas, trying to quarantine faith so it s more easily controllable. Get real, you morons. President Obama isn t trying to get rid of religion; he himself is a Christian. He s just smart enough to know that America was never meant to be a theocracy, that theocracies don t work, and that our Constitution forbids religion in lawmaking.Then again, when deluded individuals such as these two men speak on such matters, facts fly out the window and are replaced with utter lunacy.Get serious help, STAT, both of you.Watch the video of this insanity below, via Right Wing Watch:Featured image via video screen capture"
THE WORLD SHOULD BE OUTRAGED By Sweden’s Reward System For Returning Jihadists,"So Sweden basically wants to ensure Muslims returning from raping and beheading innocent people overseas, that the government will help them find a job and receive psychological counseling.  The trauma they must be experiencing after committing Jihad against so many innocent people must be overwhelming   You just can t make these things up The Swedish capital of Stockholm has released its new policy document for dealing with ISIS fighters returning to the city after having had their fill of rape and beheadings of civilians. At first blush it seems strange that such a document would be all of 9 pages.I mean,  Shoot!  should only take up one page, even with a large font.Oh well, let s see how Stockholm intends to handle terrorist-trained and combat-hardened fanatics. Here are a few translated highlights to capture the gist of things: Post-perspective: When a person wishes to leave a violent extremist grouping or coming home from combat overseas, it is crucial to provide customized inclusion efforts. Even then, it is important to have a local cooperation between various actors. Voluntary organizations can provide targeted support and advice. Even faith communities working with advice, but also psychosocial support.When it comes to people who participated in combat there is likely to be great need of health efforts. Therefore, it is important to establish cooperation between social services, social psychiatry and drug units, as well as health centers and psychiatric services (trauma, PTSD, etc.)When it comes to security, it is important that cooperation between social services, income support, employment and other efforts by the Labour Department, as well as assistance with job placement.Finally, the accommodation issue is a prerequisite that must work. Therefore, cooperative housing companies needs to be included in the post-perspective. To summarize: The city of Stockholm will make it a priority to provide the returning ISIS fighters with housing, free health care (physical and mental) and full financial support, until they have received earmarked jobs. All this of course fast-tracked past the line of law-abiding immigrants and indigenous Swedes.Since they now provide all the recruitment incentives for joining ISIS, the only thing missing is a city-run recruitment office. Oh, wait. That would the Employment Office, where it was recently revealed that tax-paid clerks were recruiting for ISIS. Sorry, my mistake!Then it s time to make proactive efforts to discourage radicalization. The solution, the city concludes, is to pour tax money into muslim organizations already in contact with the at-risk persons: Support to associations and other stakeholders locally There are examples of local actors which can contribute to efforts locally. For example, the Islamic Association and the mosque in Rinkeby-Kista has initiated education for interested parents and youths in the J rva area. It is very important to support such local initiatives. It is also important to involve local associations, some of which have contact with residents that the authorities do not come into contact with. As journalist and blogger Per Gudmundson points out, the Islamic Association of Sweden is a remarkably poor choice for  fighting Jihad  since it is the Swedish branch of the Muslim Brotherhood. Their official motto reads: Allah is our goal, the prophet is our leader, the quran is our law, Jihad is our way, and death for the honor of Allah is our greatest desire! Gudmundson notes that they are in active combat in Syria at the moment, in coalition with Jabhat al-Nusrah which is a branch of al-Qaida. Via: The Sweden Report"
 It Looks Like The Trump Campaign Just Got This Reporter Arrested,"While Donald Trump accuses Hillary Clinton of being crooked and freedom hating, a member of the press was arrested at a his Houston rally after simply inquiring about press credentials.Alex Thompson of Vice News was arrested at the Omni Westside hotel for  trespassing.  Thompson, inquiring as to whether or not his pending press credentials had been approved or denied, entered the hotel lobby to ask members of Trump s communications staff what the final say was.According to Vice News:A man who identified himself as a hotel manager then asked Thompson to leave and warned that he would be arrested if he did not. Roughly two minutes later, without further warning and while Thompson was waiting for a member of Trump s staff to clarify his access to the event, he was arrested by Houston Police, handcuffed, and escorted outside. Thompson spoke with his editors while handcuffed and said that he was never given any opportunity to explain himself to police.And just like that, a reporter was arrested for requesting an answer to his ability to report on the rally, which is his constitutional right.Ryan McCarthy, editor-in-chief of Vice, tweeted:Our reporter @AlxThomp was arrested today outside a Trump event   for doing his job https://t.co/kS2PG5Igyc  Ryan McCarthy (@mccarthyryanj) September 17, 2016Of course the Trump campaign denied any knowing or involvement of the incident, saying,  The campaign was not involved in this incident or aware of the details surrounding it. The event organizers were responsible for today s media presence and requested the campaign limit attendance to the traveling pool. Thompson was released on bond overnight, and the Houston police claimed that he issued an ultimatum: arrest him or leave him alone, because he is not leaving until he gets an answer, as he   a member of the press   is entitled to.Vice has hinted that their lawyers are working on getting the charges dropped.Given Trump and his campaign s hostility to the media (which includes threatening to sue the New York Times, tightening libel laws, and calling CNN panelists a bunch of losers), could having a reporter arrested seem too far out there? The answer is no.Whether or not Trump or anyone in his campaign made the call is not know. But we do know this much: the campaign had his credentials pending; he inquired but to no avail; he inquired again, and was arrested for  trespassing,  even though the event was public.Trump is no friend of the press, or the freedom of the press to report on the asinine and ridiculous things he and his supporters cough up. That should scare everyone.Featured image via Joe Readle/Getty Images"
BOOM! Black Activist Calls Black CA State Senator “Racist” For Supporting Mass Immigration: “A real man is Donald Trump”,"Blacks in America are seeing the writing on the wall with the push for mass immigration to America and it s not a pretty picture. Barack Hussein Obama, America s  first black president  will do more to harm the black community in his reckless attempt to create a one-party system in America than any President in the history of the United States.The unnamed activists representing the Lost American Network group makes some great points:   We in the black community We have seen videos of (Senator) Hall calling other organizations out there that are predominately white,  racists.  We would like to send a message to him. We feel that he is not representing the black community, so therefore, we feel that he is  racist.  We wanna know why black politicians like him have turned their back on the black community.  Unemployment is up to 70%  Mass immigration takes away jobs and benefits from the black community.  Mass immigration takes away medical care and housing assistance for the homeless.Watch her outstanding message to Congressman Hall here:"
 BUSTED: Uncovered Video Shows Trump Supporting Hillary In 2008 (VIDEO),"It s not news to say that Donald Trump is a phony. He s neither a great businessman nor as wealthy as he says he is. He contradicts his own words far more often than he contradicts the words of his opponent.So, who is the real Donald Trump, and does he believe a single word of what he says? Well, we can t know that for sure, but what we do know is that in 2008, Trump was a Hillary Clinton supporter. In fact, he called her  fantastic  in a Fox News (yes, Fox News) interview. Now, to be fair, he also said he was a fan of Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney. He also, despite not knowing much about him, called Barack Obama  very capable. Even eight years ago, Trump was asked whether he would ever run for president. He said he would probably never run because -you read this right   he s  too honest. Here s the video:That s wasn t the first or the last time Trump praised the woman who s standing in his way of becoming Dictator in Chief. Last month, Clinton put out an ad showing Trump heaping her with praise.The ad features the words,  Donald Trump reveals the truth about Hillary Clinton  and shows Trump saying on FOX News,  Hillary Clinton, I think, is a terrific woman.  In another clip, Trump praises her and Bill Clinton, saying,  I know her very well and I know her husband very well, and I like them both They are just really terrific people. The ad also quotes Trump praising Hillary Clinton as a  smart, tough and a very nice person,  and said,  She really works hard, and I think she does a good job. Source: TimeDoes it really matter what Trump said about Hillary Clinton in the past? He can t even keep his story straight about what he said yesterday. The damage here is not that he s contradicting himself. His supporters really don t care about that. The damage here is that Trump s supporters hate Hillary Clinton even more than they like Trump. If we could somehow play this on a nonstop loop at Walmart or wherever Trump supporters congregate, we might see a rash of exploding heads.Featured image via video screen capture. "

"SMOKING GUN? First FISA Request on Trump Tower Came After Bill Clinton, Obama’s AG Loretta Lynch Had Private Meeting On Plane","As we said yesterday, Trump would not have made these charges against Obama without having strong evidence. We predict things are about to get even uglier for the crooked Dems On June 27th of 2016, Bill Clinton met secretly with Obama Attorney General Loretta Lynch at the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.A week later FBI Director James Comey laid out in a press conference the many scandalous activities taken by Hillary Clinton while she was President Obama s Secretary of State and then he said the famous words:Our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case. We now know that the meeting between Bill Clinton and Attorney General Lynch occurred at about the same time that the Obama administration filed a request with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA) to monitor communications involving Donald Trump and several advisers.The request, uncharacteristically, was denied.Fast forward to October 2016. Wikileaks began releasing emails of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta, rolling out batches every day until the election, creating new mini-scandals. These emails were virtually ignored by the mainstream media who were in the bag for Democrat Hillary Clinton but were spread widely by websites that chose to share the truth like this one.At the same time, The Obama administration submitted a new, narrow request to the FISA court, now focused on a computer server in Trump Tower suspected of links to Russian banks.At about this same time the leaks started coming. Liberal website Slate posted a report on October 31st titled: Was a Trump Server Communicating With Russia? The subtitle to the post read:  This spring, a group of computer scientists set out to determine whether hackers were interfering with the Trump campaign. They found something they weren t expecting.

 WATCH: President Obama Dares Republicans To Support Gun Control To Prove They Care About Cop Safety,"Conservatives talk the talk but can they walk the walk?That s exactly what President Obama dared them to do during a press conference in Warsaw, Poland on Saturday when he asked them to prove they truly care about the lives of police officers by supporting common sense gun measures to make the jobs of cops easier and safer.Republicans have repeatedly blamed President Obama and Black Lives Matter for the killing of five police officers in Dallas, Texas all while professing their own love of police officers and concern for their safety.President Obama told reporters that police have a tough job to do and made it clear that the actions of the Dallas shooter should not be assumed to be supported by all black people just as people did not blame all white people for the Charleston church shooting in South Carolina. When some white kid walks into a church and shoots a bunch of worshipers who invite him to worship with them we don t assume somehow he s making a political statement that s relevant to the attitudes of the rest of America. And we shouldn t make those assumptions about a troubled Muslim individual who is acting on their own in that same way. President Obama then moved on to speak about guns and the role they play in these tragedies. I am going to keep talking about the fact that we cannot eliminate all racial tension in our country overnight. We are not going to be able to identify ahead of time and eliminate every madman or troubled individual who might want to do harm against innocent people. But we can make it harder for them to do so. President Obama mentioned the harrowing number of gun violence incidents that have occurred in this country for the last ten years, pointing out that there is a  pattern  of gun violence that makes America  unique in the scale of violence that we experience  including mass shootings and gun murders we mostly consider  routine.  President Obama mentioned his hometown of Chicago as an example.President Obama then made a connection between all of these shootings and the lack of gun restrictions that make it harder for people officers to do their jobs. Part of what s creating tensions between communities and the police is the fact that police have a really difficult time in communities where they know guns are everywhere,  he said before using Dallas as an example because protesters participating in the rally that night exercised their right to open carry because Texas is an open-carry state. Because of all the guns around, the confused police initially had trouble figuring out who was shooting at them, even aiming their guns at the crowd before discovering where the shots were really coming from.With that said, President Obama challenged Republicans to put their money where their mouth is and treat guns as a contributing factor to gun violence if they really care about the lives of police as they claim: If you care about the safety of our police officers, then you can t set aside the gun issue and pretend that s irrelevant We can t just ignore that and pretend that that s somehow political or the president is just pushing his policy agenda. It s a contributing factor, not the sole factor, but a contributing factor to the broader tensions that arise between police and the communities where they serve There is a way to talk about that that is consistent with our Constitution and the Second Amendment. The problem is even mention of it somehow evokes this kind of polarization between a very intense minority and a majority of Americans who think we could do better when it comes to gun safety. Here s the video via Youtube.Conservatives want everyone to believe that there is a war between cops and black people, probably because they are hoping for one so the NRA and gun industry can make more money selling guns to every person they successfully scare with their bullshit. But the fact is that if the Dallas shooter had not had access to a high-powered assault rifle, there would be more police officers alive today.

Obama Administration Giving Out Green Cards Like Candy To Migrants From Muslim Nations,"OUR GOVERNMENT IS GIVING OUT GREEN CARDS LIKE CANDY at double the rate to Muslims over everyone else. A green card is a path to American citizenship so this is very important. Besides the security risk, this is an attempt to change the nation forever. Look at Europe! The citizens of Europe are screaming to get their sovereignty back after basically being invaded by thousands and thousands of Muslims. This is a quiet invasion but is still very serious and wrong: National security has never appeared to be a priority for the Obama administration, but this is downright alarming as the U.S. encounters burgeoning threats from radical Islamists. With Islamic terrorism on the rise in the United States and Western Europe, it s worth mentioning that the Obama administration issued around 680,000 green cards to foreigners from Muslim countries during a five-year period, according to data published by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The stats, the latest made available by DHS, also show that the U.S. government admits more than double the number of immigrants from Muslim nations than from the European Union.This disturbing information was circulated by the Senate Judiciary Committee s subcommittee on Immigration, which assesses that if there s no change in the current policy, the U.S. will likely grant another 680,000 migrants possibly more from Muslim-majority countries green cards in the next five years. According to the DHS figures cited by the panel, Uncle Sam issued approximately 680,000 green cards to immigrants from 49 Muslim nations from fiscal year 2009 through fiscal year 2013. Over the same period, the U.S. issued only 270,000 green cards to migrants from the European Union, according to a committee announcement that reminds us  a green card entitles recipients to access federal benefits, lifetime residency, work authorization, and a direct route to becoming a U.S. citizen.  Some of the recipients are admitted to the U.S. as refugees so they immediately qualify for federal welfare benefits like food stamps and Medicaid.The DHS stats include a breakdown of the countries where the migrants came from. Pakistan and Iraq sent over the most with 83,000 apiece and Bangladesh had 75,000. Seventy-three thousand came from Iran, 45,000 from Egypt, 31,000 from Somalia, 24,000 from Uzbekistan, Turkey and Morocco had 22,000 each, Jordan and Albania 20,000 each and Lebanon and Yemen each had 16,000. Rounding out the five-digit club is Indonesia (15,000), Syria (14,000), Sudan (13,000), Afghanistan (11,000) and Sierra Leone (10,000). The rest, including Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Kosovo and Libya, only sent over a few thousand during the five-year period covered by the DHS data. By contrast, only 65,000 green cards were granted to migrants from the European Union country (United Kingdom) with the highest number during this period. The Senate committee reveals that DHS has not yet published statistics covering fiscal year 2014 and fiscal year 2015 so we ll be on the lookout for that.National security has never appeared to be a priority for the Obama administration, but this is downright alarming as the U.S. encounters burgeoning threats from radical Islamists.Read more: Judicial Watch"
 WATCH: Obama Takes A PERFECT Shot At Trump’s Never Ending Tweeting,"President Obama appeared at a campaign rally alongside Hillary Clinton, and just couldn t resist getting in a dig or two about our wannabe Tweeter-in-Chief (because really, he makes it so easy). He said that generally, people don t understand the job that is being President of the United States, and then went into expert-marksman mode to hit Trump for his tweeting and lack of experience: Everybody can tweet, but nobody actually knows what it takes to do the job until you sit behind the desk. I mean, Sasha tweets, but she doesn t think that she s thereby should be sitting behind the desk. The implication is that his daughter, Sasha, is smarter than King Dunce because she knows tweeting is just tweeting. King Dunce uses Twitter as a weapon, talking himself up and tearing down anybody he doesn t like with childish namecalling, complete ignorance, and outright lies. What his tweeting does is actually show him for the fraud he is.Watch him hit Drumpf below, via ABC News:.@POTUS takes shot at Donald Trump at Clinton rally:  Everybody can tweet  https://t.co/i2lNlfUQnT https://t.co/Lr5grwuuQz  ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) July 5, 2016Obama also talked up Hillary s qualifications in that speech, explaining how he s come a very long way in how he sees her since the 2008 election cycle, when they were opponents. She, likewise, praised Obama, saying she d been privileged to see him in so many different roles. Then she took her own shot at the Dunce-in-Chief s birtherism and tweeting, saying: And Donald, if you are out there tweeting, it is Hawaii. The snark is strong in these two. Tweetle-Drumpf hasn t tweeted a response to this yet, but if he does, it will lack the sharp edge of experience and intelligence that Obama and Hillary display, even in their snarkiness.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video"
 Watch NBC’s Andrea Mitchell Get BULLIED Out Of The State Dept. For Asking About Russia (VIDEO),"If one thing has become abundantly clear, it s that Donald Trump and his administration don t like to answer questions, especially questions surrounding Russia.Trump seems to have set a clear standard for those who work with him that the press is not to be trusted. From his abusive and unconstitutional  fake news  attacks to the clear ignoring of questions that the American people want to know the answers to.Ignoring questions and treating the press like dirt has seemingly also spread to the State Department, and on Tuesday morning, NBC s Andrea Mitchell alongside several others from the press were herded up and bullied out, all the while no questions were answered.Mitchell tried to get a few pressing answers from Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. She asked: Can you respond to the threats from China? Can you be sure the Trump administration will be strong against Vladimir Putin? Can you assure us that Russia will not be able to move further in Ukraine? You can then see Mitchell grabbed by the arms and escorted out while saying: We haven t had any time in here. This all begs the question, why doesn t the Trump administration want to answer any questions? What are they hiding?The more they remain elusive from the press, the more people will assume they are up to no good, so one would think they would want to remain transparent and respect the right of a free press.What this shows is that our press are disrespected, but it also shows that press, especially those like Andrea Mitchell, aren t about to be bullied around so easily and will still report the story.Good.Watch the confrontation here:You guys. This happened today.This is why we   Andrea @mitchellreports. There is nobody more dogged, more tenacious.

NOT-SO-SLICK WILLY: Bill Clinton Tries To Joke Around About Hillary’s E-mail Scandal…Not Funny [Video], 
 FL Crowd Says ‘Amen’ When ‘Christian’ Man Brags About Molesting Children And Getting Away With It (VIDEO),"Jacksonville, Florida police are investigating a man after he stood in front of the City Council and told them he spent most of his life molesting children and getting away with it.The comments came during a Tuesday night debate over Jacksonville s Human Rights Ordinance, which would further protect the LGBT community in the city. Roy Bay, 56, stood up during the public comment part of the council meeting and said: I lived most of my life sexually assaulting kids and never went to jail. Because why? Kids believed me that hey this is, you re alright son. This is not a problem. Okay? This happens in homosexual lifestyle. Bay claims that the reason he started molesting children was because he was  sexually assaulted by the homosexual community  from the age of ten to twelve.The WHOLE homosexual community? Really? WOW.He said that he  entered into the life of homosexuality  afterwards and that is when he started molesting kids. He then claimed that in 1995 he became a  born-again child of God  and  God set him free  from his lifestyle of raping innocent children. When he mentioned  God  some members of the crowd began to clap and say  amen. News4Jax reports that the sheriff s department was informed of Bay s criminal confession and they said that there will be an investigation into his alleged crimes. There is no statute of limitations for child molestation in the state of Florida if the victims are under the age of twelve. So, it is entirely possible that his LGBT-bashing confession might land him in prison.Bay s assertions that the gay community is filled with predators like himself is completely unfounded. UC Davis published a 1982 study by Dr. A. Nicholas Groth that found that children are not in greater danger of being molested by homosexuals than heterosexuals:Are homosexual adults in general sexually attracted to children and are preadolescent children at greater risk of molestation from homosexual adults than from heterosexual adults? There is no reason to believe so. The research to date all points to there being no significant relationship between a homosexual lifestyle and child molestation. There appears to be practically no reportage of sexual molestation of girls by lesbian adults, and the adult male who sexually molests young boys is not likely to be homosexual.This is because, contrary to what Bay says, rape is never about sexuality, it is about power. The desire to have complete control over somebody is what fuels rapists and if Bay is the predator he claims to be, that is likely the reason he was raping children. The crowd members who shouted  amen  and clapped are probably the same imbeciles who support known child molester Josh Duggar. People like Duggar and Bay hide behind their Bible and commit atrocious crimes all while pushing disgusting stereotypes about the LGBT community to hide their own crimes.Hopefully, the police will find some evidence about this guy s crimes and put him in prison where he belongs.Watch:Featured image via video screenshot "
TOP DEMOCRAT ACTIVIST WHO LAUNCHED ONLINE CAMPAIGN TO THREATEN AND BULLY 12 YR OLD CONSERVATIVE Is Facing Charges [Video],"CJ Pearson, the 12 year old conservative social media sensation who was bullied and threatened by grown-ups on the left, has more class in his little finger than the entire Democrat party combined. Here is a video message to President Barack Obama by CJ Pearson regarding his hatred for America that has over 1 million hits:The woman who launched an online campaign of bullying and veiled threats against Internet sensation CJ Pearson, frightening the young conservative s family enough to drive the boy briefly out of politics late last week, has been identified as a  top Democratic activist  from Baltimore.And the Pearson family is planning to press charges.According to a Facebook posting Sunday by Ali A. Akbar of Vice and Victory, a consulting firm that works with CJ, the woman behind the Twitter account  Mona Hussein Obama  is actually named Mona Brown. What she did was against the law,  Akbar said on the video, vowing to  expose a troll, a bully, a grown adult and top Democrat activist in Maryland for bullying a 12-year-old. Late last week, Brown began her Twitter campaign of harassment against Pearson in retaliation for Internet videos harshly critical of Obama that have made the boy an Internet sensation. Her tweets ranged from insults    your fam has been bowing down to white ppl    to hints of violence  Wish we could switch Trayvon s life for yours. On Facebook Friday, the 12-year-old announced he had had enough. After much thought and consideration, I ve decided to take a break from politics and political commentary,  he wrote.  I had a horribly rough night on Twitter after a woman not only threatened to sue me for expressing my opinions but threatened my family. The boy handed over his social media accounts to Vice and Victory, which quickly set up a support fund and hashtag #StandWithCJ.CJ s Facebook page now includes an apology Brown sent after her true identity became known. I apologize and am deeply ashamed of the horrible statements I made to @cjpearson,  she wrote.She then goes on to complain about how  the right wing  is attacking her family   apparently missing the irony that she earlier attacked the Pearson family and wished for their death.Pearson plans to get back into politics and says that the incident has only made his resolve stronger. After much thought and consideration, I have decided to press forward and continue to fight for what I believe in,  he wrote on Facebook.  Mona s hate has only strengthened my resolve and has encouraged me to continue to do what I love and what I do best. Via: Biz Pac Review"

JUST IN: SUPREME COURT Rules On Trump Travel Ban,"Another winner for America and for President Trump! The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the travel ban! Guess who voted against it Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor said they would have left the lower court orders in place. Is anyone surprised by the two lefty judges? Not us!Fox News reports:Handing the White House a huge judicial victory, the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday ruled in favor of President Trump s travel ban affecting residents of six majority-Muslim countries.The justices said the policy can take full effect despite multiple legal challenges against it that haven t yet made their way through the court system.The ban applies to people from Syria, Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia and Yemen.Lower courts had said people from those countries with a  bona fide  relationship with someone in the United States could not be prevented from entry.Grandparents and cousins were among the relatives courts said could not be excluded.The nine-member high court said in two one-page orders late Monday afternoon that lower court rulings that partly blocked the ban should be put on hold while appeals courts in Richmond, Va., and San Francisco take up the case.Liberal-leaning Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor said they would have left the lower court orders in place.Both courts are scheduled to hear arguments in those cases this week.Both courts are also dealing with the issue on an accelerated basis, and the Supreme Court noted it expects those courts to reach decisions  with appropriate dispatch. Quick resolution by appellate courts would allow the Supreme Court to hear and decide the issue this term, by the end of June.Trump s travel ban has been challenged in separate lawsuits by Hawaii and the American Civil Liberties Union. Both have argued the ban discriminates against Muslims and should not go into effect under immigration laws."
" Trump STRANDED, In Full Panic As ANOTHER Performer Drops Out Of Inauguration (DETAILS)","President-elect Donald Trump has had trouble finding people to perform at his inauguration from the moment he won the election. While A-list artists have usually jumped at the opportunity to sing or play for a new President, celebrities have turned Trump down left and right. It s been a massive public embarrassment for Trump, even as his team uses bribery to get gigs and continues to fail.The humiliation is far from over. The VERY few acts that agreed to perform for Trump are now dwindling. The latest to pull out just days before Trump s big day is the B-Street Band, a Bruce Springsteen cover band. The cover band has just announced that, due to the backlash the group received since news broke that they would play for Trump, they are abandoning the gig.In an interview with Rolling Stone, Will Forte, the group s keyboardist, manager, agent and publicist, said that the band received  thousands of emails  that made the band reconsider. He recalled saying to his band members,  We re standing out in the storm right here. We gotta get out of the storm. Due to the fact that Springsteen himself had publicly condemned Trump many times before, the band thought it would only be right to honor him and the fans that had made the Springsteen cover band a reality. Forte said: We owe everything to [Bruce] and our gratitude and respect to the band is imperative above all else. We felt that we had to make it known that we didn t want to seem disrespectful, in any way, shape or form, to Bruce and his music and his band. I don t want to upset them. We owe everything to him and our gratitude and respect to the band is imperative above all else. It became clear to us that this wasn t working and we just had to do what we thought was the right thing to do and that was to pull out. TwitterThe B-Street Band had actually signed a contract in 2013 to play at this year s gig, but that was before the presidential nominees had been voted on. The band never thought they might have to play for Trump. Forte revealed: As time went by, the complexity of the situation became real immense and intense. The band was caught in a hurricane. We didn t see this coming, of course. When I started this band 37 years ago, it was only about performing and making people happy. I never thought the distortion of what we do as a band would ve been so intense. I wish it never would ve happened. We would ve never got involved in this if I knew how this would turn out. I would trade in all the support and publicity just to go back to where we were four months ago. I don t think they ll ever be a cover band of our size in the history of music that will get the attention of something this big. I m worn out. The band s worn out. Everybody loves to have their 15 minutes of fame, but maybe not this way. TwitterForte acknowledges that the the B-Street Band may now be punished financially for breaking the contract, but considers its stance more important. Forte said: So far, it s okay. But that s all I can say. Whatever the consequences are for breaking a contract, I m willing to take because this is much more important. Trump is literally about to be left stranded at his inauguration.Featured image by Drew Angerer via Getty Images"
BREAKING: Man Rushes To Paris Police Station Doors With Knife Screaming “Allahu Akbar”…Was He Another “Muslim Clock Boy?”,"It doesn t appear the man rushing to doors of a Paris police station with a knife, screaming  Allahu Akbar  wearing a fake suicide vest will garner a visit to France s President Francois Hollande s office. While France has made the decision to take a hard-line on Muslim terrorists, Obama and his Attorney General, Loretta Lynch have taken a hard-line against any American who uses language that they consider  hate speech  against Muslims. The idea that the  Muslim Clock Boy  (a term that we coined) was able to take a fake bomb to school and become an overnight celebrity, as our  victim of the month  in America tells us all we need to know about how seriously the Left has taken the threat of terrorism in America. Paris police shot dead on Thursday a man wielding a knife after he tried to enter a police station shouting  Allahu Akbar  (God is Great) and wearing what turned out to be a fake suicide belt.The incident took place exactly one year after deadly Islamist militant attacks on the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine in the French capital and also just minutes after President Francois Hollande had given a speech in an another part of Paris to mark the anniversary. The man may have been wearing something that could be a suicide belt,  Interior Ministry spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet told BFM TV. Brandet later confirmed to Reuters that the suicide belt was fake.France has been on high alert ever since the shootings last January at the Charlie Hebdo office and at a Jewish supermarket in which 17 people died over three days.Security concerns were further heightened in November, when 130 people were killed in the capital in coordinated shootings and suicide bombings that targeted a music hall, bars and restaurants and a soccer stadium.Islamic State, the militant group that controls swathes of Iraq and Syria, claimed responsibility for the Nov. 13 attacks. Several of the militants involved in those attacks were, like last January s killers, French-born.In Thursday s incident, the man tried to force his way into the police station in the 18th district in northern Paris, an area that Islamic State said it had been planning to hit as part of the November attacks.WIRES PROTRUDING According to our colleagues, he wanted to blow himself up,  an official at the Alternative Police union said.  He shouted Allahu Akbar and had wires protruding from his clothes. That s why the police officer opened fire. Officials said bomb disposal experts were on site.Journalist Anna Polonyi, who could see the outside of the police station from the window of her flat, posted photos on social media that showed what appeared to be a bomb-disposal robot beside the body.She told Reuters that her sister, in the flat with her, had seen the incident happen. She said the police shouted at the man and that he then started running towards them before they shot him.Last year s attacks have boosted the popularity of the far-right National Front party ahead of a presidential election due in 2017.In his speech, Hollande promised to better equip police to prevent further militant attacks.The president also defended draconian security measures implemented since November that his Socialist government had once shunned.

THE YOUNG GIRL THE CLINTONS DESTROYED…Monica Lewinsky: “I’m Probably The Only 41 Year Old Who Doesn’t Want To Be 22 Again”," In 1998, I lost my reputation and my dignity. I lost everything and I almost lost my life  -Monica Lewinsky, 2015Here is Monica Lewinsky, now a 41 year old woman who is actually being paid to address audiences about how her affair with then President Bill Clinton destroyed her life. What price did Bill Clinton pay for destroying this young girl s life? What price did Hillary pay for enabling his behavior (that bordered on pedophilia given the age difference between Bill and Monica)? This young girl was  slut shamed  by the entire world while Bill and Hillary, unconcerned with her well-being, huddled together to work out the details of how they would deceive the world with lies and save their political careers and ambitions. Hillary even went so far as to call Monica a  narcissistic looney tune. Does anyone really believe the audience at this event had any desire to hear what Monica Lewinsky had to say about the age of media, and how it affects people s lives? They wanted to hear about what it was like to have an affair with the former President of the United States of America, who also happens to be a serial philanderer, and is still married to a woman who pretends to be a champion for other women. The Clinton machine made sure Monica Lewinsky didn t receive any compassion from the media. She was made into a public joke, and humiliated by a rabid press who was looking for someone other than the Clinton s to blame for the shame that Bill Clinton brought to the office of President of The United States.The Clinton s never gave a damn about this young girl they only cared how about how they could spin it with the media, so as not to affect Hillary s Presidential ambitions "
Is Conservative Firebrand Laura Ingraham Joining Fox News?,"Will radio host and television commentator Laura Ingraham become a prime time host at Fox News? The word is that Ingraham will be taking the ten o clock spot.The rumor started when Matt Drudge of The Drudge Report hinted that Ingraham had a spot on Fox lined up.Ingraham has been telling friends that the deal is essentially done, with just a few details to iron out, CNN reports.Ingraham s taking over of ten o clock is part of a larger restructuring of Fox s lineup. Sean Hannity s show will move from its current ten o clock slot to nine p.m. And  The Five  will move back to five p.m. from its current nine o clock time.This shift was almost certainly prompted by the firing of Eric Bolling and concurrent cancelling of Bolling s panel show,  The Specialists,  which previously filled the five o clock slot. Bolling had been under internal investigation following accusations of sexual misconduct on his part, claims which Bolling fervently denies.Bolling s sudden exit is part of a larger shake-up at Fox prompted by allegations of sexual misconduct. Fox Chairman and CEO Roger Ailes left in July 2016, while Bill O Reilly left in April after 21 years at the network, both for similar reasons.It is not known when the show will begin airing, but CNN s sources say that the deal has been confirmed. A Fox News spokeswoman denied the existence of the deal to CNN.We certainly hope this is a done deal. Ingraham gets the Trump voter and isn t in the DC bubble.

 Watch Elizabeth Warren Clobber Trump And Scott Brown: ‘Celebrity Apprentice Meets Biggest Loser’,"Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren once again took aim at Donald Trump and took no prisoners as she hilariously mocked the possibility of a Trump ticket with her one-time rival Scott Brown as his running mate.Warren began her speech at the New Hampshire Democratic Convention on Saturday by apologizing to the state for beating Brown in her home state because she  never expected  him to become New Hampshire s problem. And from there, Warren proceeded to lampoon the idea of Brown as Trump s vice-presidential nominee. I hear that Donald Trump is floating Scott Brown as a possible running mate. And I thought,  Oh, so Donald Trump really does have a plan to help the unemployed.' The crowd erupted in laughter as Warren continued landing punches with more jokes. Scott Brown for vice-president makes a certain kind of sense. I mean that. I think of all the expert advice he can offer Donald Trump. Making up lies about me and my family. Saying weird stuff about his beautiful daughter. And let s face it, nobody knows more about losing to a girl than Scott Brown. Think of it as the perfect reality TV show: Celebrity Apprentice meets The Biggest Loser. Warren then set the jokes aside and took a more serious tone as she focused all of her fire on the Republican nominee. Every day we learn more about him, and every day it becomes clearer that he is just a small, insecure money-grubber who doesn t care about anyone or anything that doesn t have the Trump name splashed all over it. Every day it becomes clearer that he is a thin-skinned, racist, sexist bully. Every day it becomes clearer that he will never be president of the United States. Then she likened Trump s scam university to a used car dealership, but pointed out that the comparison isn t really  fair to used car dealerships. Here is a man who runs a business to profit off other people s pain,  she continued before slamming Trump for whining about the judge overseeing the lawsuit against him. Poor little Donald is shaking in his high-priced Italian loafers, begging the court to protect him,  she quipped.  Are you scared, Donald? You should be. Here s the full speech via YouTube:Donald Trump just got his ass handed to him by Elizabeth Warren. And if he really is thinking about picking Scott Brown as his running mate he should probably think again since it s clear such a pairing would be lampooned in the same way for months leading up to the election in November. And that s not a good thing for the GOP. It would be a disaster. Just like it would be a disaster for this nation if Trump somehow wins the election.Featured Image: Screenshot"
"PAY 2 PLAY: Democratic Convention Ends Amid Controversy, Empty Seats & White Noise","Shawn Helton 21st Century WireThe 2016 Democratic National Convention was the latest in a long line of sordid political productions  It was a tough week for the Clinton  change makers  as Bernie Sanders delegates staged a mass walkout after a series of email leaks disclosed that a Clinton lawyer gave the DNC strategy advice on how to sideline the Sanders campaign.There were also claims of white noise machines used to quell any anti-Clinton dissent inside the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia. Help Wanted: Actors Needed Putting aside the fact that today s US presidential conventions have turned into celebrity show business promotional events (pop star Katie Perry, Ted Danson, and even British actor Orlando Bloom et all), there s another more disturbing controversy emerging   this time over a Craigslist ad stating that,  actors were needed for a national convention    prompting critics to suggest empty seats had to be filled prior to the end of the convention and that the July 27th ad was at the behest of the DNC.Whether or not all or some of the claims above are fully accurate, 2016 s DNC was unquestionably a contentious affair filled with a heavy dose of identity politics.In fact, the star-studded event conjured the bizarre Orlando Pulse nightclub shooting from just over a month ago by having Christine Leinonen speak at the convention, a former Michigan State Police trooper/Florida Attorney turned Wheel of Fortune hopeful, and mother of Christopher (Drew) Leinonen, an apparent victim of America s largest mass shooting. Here s Australia s Peekay Truth on YouTube examining the phenomena surrounding Christine Leinonen Interestingly, Chris Leinonen s pro gun father Mark Bando, a former patrol officer for the city of Detroit PD from 1974-99, did not speak at the convention on behalf of his son.Additionally at Leinonen s speech at the DNC, she was accompanied by Pulse nightclub shooting survivor Brandon Wolf, who just happens to be a former runner-up on Bravo TV s The Kandi Factory. We ve noted before, the many strange Hollywood links to the Pulse shooting, including the apparent actor-cum-shooter Omar Mateen.Below is a YouTube video from the user Run2Christ HD, which investigates the many casting connections linked to Brandon Wolf, while also disclosing that one of the Pulse nightclub founders, Ron Legler, is the president of the Florida Theatrical Association and a booking agent for national touring broadway productions. Some of FTA s productions include The Lion King, Chicago and The Phantom of the Opera.Here s Brandon Wolf ready for his close-up Here s a screen shot of Ron Legler s professional background Here at 21WIRE, we examined much of the anomalies associated with the Orlando shooting, an event that failed to account for any shootings said to have taken place within the nightclub, as the FBI s own transcript made no mention of individuals being shot inside the club.If you remember, according to FOX analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano plainly states that all of the Pulse nightclub victims met their fate when Orlando police entered the building Here s a You Tube video montage from Educate Yourself, that displays some of the strange behaviour exhibited by Christine Leinonen More DNC discussion from Zero Hedge below DNC NIGHTMARE?    Empty seats observed during roll call at the DNC. (Image Source: fellowshipofminds)Zero HedgeDid The DNC Hire Actors (At Below Minimum Wage) To Work At The Convention?Following the exposure of a fake Trump job advertisement designed by The DNC to embarrass Trump, it is interesting that a Craigslist ad calling for  Actors Needed for National Convention  has surfaced Whether the ad is real or fake is unclear, but the text suggests below minimum wage compensation (7-plus hours work for $50) and the number of walkouts from the Convention indicates perhaps a need for cheering happy seat-fillers SNOOZEFEST    Bill Clinton nods off during Hillary s vacuous speech. (Image Source: YouTube)Actors Needed For National Convention (Philadelphia) compensation: $50.00 Looking for 700 people to be utilized as actors during the National Convention. We currently have a number of empty seats that will need to be filled as we are currently removing a number of people and need to refill their seats for the remainder of the conference. You will be paid $50.00 each night for the remainder of the convention. You will be required to cheer at all times and will be asked to dress properly and possibly wear some promotional material.Which makes sense if one looks at the following shocking video from film director, Josh Fox, best known for his Oscar-nominated anti-fracking documentary Gasland, captured inside the DNC As DailyWire.com reports, Fox tells the camera   This is amazing, this place is empty. There is nobody left in here. I mean this whole stadium, look at this,  as he pans his cellphone to show the lack of cheering Dems.He continues in disbelief, adding,  This is not voter enthusiasm . I can t believe my eyes. I ve never seen anything like this. This is the primetime of the Democratic National Convention right after the nomination of Hillary Clinton and this place is emptied out like crazy. I m stunned. This is insane. The whole California delegation is pretty much gone,  he adds.  I mean this has got to be something very worrisome for the Democrats. Voter enthusiasm wins elections.

 Sanders Fans Break Fundraising Site After NH Primary Win (VIDEO/TWEETS),"After Bernie Sanders  win in New Hampshire on Tuesday night, so many people contributed to his campaign that ActBlue, the fundraising service used by Democratic candidates, is having trouble processing the donations. That s because during his victory speech, Sanders said: I m not going to New York City to host a fundraiser on Wall Street. Instead, I m going to hold a fundraiser right here, right now, across America. My request is please go to BernieSanders.com and contribute. So there it is, that s our fundraiser. Pretty quick,  Sanders concluded. That  fundraiser  brought in more than $5.1 million dollars in one night for Sanders.  It was a Yuuuge night for the Democratic candidate.Here is the victory speech that broke the internet:Sanders supporters took to Twitter to complain that their contributions were not going through. Act Blue is doing the best they can to deal with the new flood of donations being sent to Sanders.Huge night! Contributions are processing, receipts are a little delayed. Keep the donations coming!!  ActBlue (@actblue) February 10, 2016Our customer service team is always available for support. Just email [email protected] and someone will get back to you.  ActBlue (@actblue) February 10, 2016 ActBlue laid out what happened to cause the issues, in a blog post: Last night s spontaneous fundraiser (the one that raised $5.2 million in less than a day) broke our external processor s response systems. That s some amazing grassroots power. Like we said, we over-prepare, so we were ready for that. But the vendor started giving us a previously undocumented error message, which temporarily caused some donors to not move from the  please wait  page to the confirmation page even though their contributions were already fully processed As a certain hilarious SNL skit pointed out, we all know that Bernie Sanders  average campaign donation is $27 dollars. The people-powered campaign has already smashed President Obama s previous record for the highest number of contributions. The fact that people are making smaller donations to Sanders  campaign gives the candidate a huge advantage in terms of grassroots fundraising. Since very few people have donated the maximum amount they can, supporters can continue to donate to Sanders  campaign throughout the primary season.That might have something to do with why Sanders  raised more money than Hillary Clinton s campaign in January. In January, Sanders received $20 million dollars in donations, while Clinton raised $15 million dollars.Rest assured, anxious Berners.  The campaign s site is up and running and this shouldn t be a problem anymore. Be happy, this is  probably the best problem any candidate could ever have during an election.Featured image from video screenshot via YouTube"
EMBARRASSING: Obama Spends Final Hours With Troops Defending His Failure As Commander In Chief…Bashing Trump [VIDEO],"President Barack Obama claimed the United States is  breaking the back of ISIS  in his final national security speech before leaving office and told armed service members the country is depending on them to  carry forward what is best in us. Obama directed the bulk of his counter-terror speech to criticisms of his policies leveled by President-elect Donald Trump during his successful campaign   but did not mention his successor by name. We are a nation that our best has been defined by hope and not fear,  Obama told them in his Tuesday address.The nation s commander in chief recounted the United States  defining moments in the Civil War, WWII, when American soldiers  stormed the beaches of Normandy  and  climbed the hills of Iwo Jima,  and the civil rights era. That s who we are. That is what makes us stronger than any act of terror,  he told troops stationed at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa.  Remember that history. Remember what that flag stands for.    DMFunny, Barack Obama couldn t find it in his heart to speak out against those who openly disrespect our flag like Black Lives Matter acitivists or 49er s Quarterback Colin Kaepernick, or others who disrespect or burn our flag in the name of oppression and hate."
ABSOLUTE SUBMISSION: Trump Bows to Neocon Orthodoxy,"Consortium News Exclusive: In his Mideast trip to Saudi Arabia and Israel, President Trump sought some political safe harbor by tacking toward neocon orthodoxy and jettisoning his campaign promises of a more rational strategy, writes Daniel Lazare.Daniel Lazare Consortium NewsWith astounding precision, Donald Trump zeroed in on the worst possible Middle East policy option in his recent trip to Saudi Arabia and made it his own. He rebuffed the efforts of Iran s newly elected moderate government to open up communications with the West and instead deepened America s alliances with decrepit autocratic regimes across the Persian Gulf.Turning up his nose at Iran   a rising young power   he embraced Saudi Arabia, which is plainly on its last legs. It was a remarkable display    rather like visiting a butcher shop and passing up a fresh steak for one that s rancid and smelly and buzzing with flies.Saudi Arabia is not just any tired dictatorship with an abysmal human-rights record but one of the most spectacularly dysfunctional societies in history. It takes in half a billion dollars a day in oil revenue, yet is so profligate that it could run out of money in half a decade. It sits atop 18 percent of the world s proven oil reserves, yet is so wasteful that, at current rates, it will become a net importer by the year 2030.Its king travels with a thousand-person retinue wherever he goes while his son, Deputy Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman, plunked down $550 million not long ago when a 440-foot yacht caught his eye in the south of France. Yet this pair of royal kleptocrats dares preach austerity at a time when as much as 25 percent of the population lives on less than $17 a day in trash-strewn Third World slums.Similarly, Saudi Arabia s appetite for high-tech weaponry is such that in 2015 it became the largest arms importer in the world. Yet its military is so inept that it is unable to subdue ragtag Houthi rebels in neighboring Yemen or even stop them from raiding deep inside Saudi territory and launching regular missile attacks.The kingdom accuses Iran of sectarianism yet bans all religions other than Islam, arrests Christians for the  crime  of praying and possessing Bibles, equates atheism with terrorism, and has imposed a state of siege on Shi ite Muslims in its own Eastern Province. Although a bit restrained of late, its religious police are notorious for roaming the shopping malls and striking out with canes at anyone violating shari a law.As the English novelist Hilary Mantel (of Wolf Hall fame) recalled of the four years she spent in the kingdom with her geologist husband, it was impossible to know what might arouse their ire:  it might be the flashing denim legs of a Filipina girl revealed for a second beneath an abaya gone adrift, or it might be the plate-glass shop front of a business that, as the evening prayer call spiraled through the damp air-conditioned halls, had failed to slam down its metal shutters fast enough. What were the rules? No one knew. Saudi Arabia also denounces terrorism at every turn even though its funding groups like Al Qaeda and ISIS (also known as ISIL and Islamic State) is an open secret. In 2009, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton complained in a diplomatic memo made public by Wikileaks that  donors in Saudi Arabia constitute the most significant source of funding to Sunni terrorist groups worldwide.  In September 2014, she observed that  Qatar and Saudi Arabia   are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region. A few days later, Vice President Joe Biden told a Harvard audience that  the Saudis, the emirates, etc.   were so determined to take down [Syrian President Bashar al-] Assad and essentially have a proxy Sunni-Shia war   [that] they poured hundreds of millions of dollars and tens of thousands of tons of military weapons into anyone who would fight against Assad, except the people who were being supplied were Al Nusra and Al Qaeda and the extremist elements of jihadis coming from other parts of the world.  (Quote starts at 53:30.)Arming the SaudisRather than fighting ISIS and Al Qaeda, the Saudis give them money so that they can wage jihad on religious minorities. Yet this is the country that Trump now calls upon to  drive out the terrorists and extremists,  which is as ludicrous as relying on the KKK to drive out racism. It s also the country that he hopes will serve as the cornerstone of an  Arab NATO  so that he can sell it more jet fighters and Blackhawk helicopters.But the Saudi military is already top-heavy with such gear while at the same time so short of infantry that it relies on ill-trained Sudanese mercenaries, scores of whom were reportedly killed in a recent battle in the Red Sea province of Midi in Yemen s north. This is not surprising since no Saudi in his right mind wants to serve as a foot soldier so that the deputy crown prince can buy another yacht. But more such purchases will only add to the military imbalance while adding more fuel to the broader Middle East conflagration.So how did this god-awful marriage come about? Is it all Trump s fault? Or have others contributed to the mess? The answer, of course, is the latter.Every president since Franklin Roosevelt has contributed to the catastrophe. Roosevelt declared Saudi Arabia a U.S. protectorate while Dwight Eisenhower got it into his head that a corrupt desert monarchy would somehow be useful in the fight against Communism. Worried that it might come under Soviet influence, Jimmy Carter commenced a military buildup in the Persian Gulf that, according to a 2009 Princeton University study, has now surpassed the $10-trillion mark.Ronald Reagan relied on the Saudis to finance arms to the Nicaraguan Contras and to Jonas Savimbi s pro-apartheid guerrillas in Angola. George H.W. Bush launched a major war to save the Saudis from the evil Saddam Hussein. George W. Bush and Barack Obama covered up the Saudi role in 9/11, while Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton encouraged them and other Gulf monarchies to fund anti-government rebels in Libya and Syria during the Arab Spring. Both Libya and Syria fell to ruin as a consequence as hundreds of millions of dollars flowed to pro-Al Qaeda forces and the flames of Wahhabist terrorism spread ever wider.Indeed, Donald Trump for a while seemed to augur something different. Rather than praising the kingdom, he denounced it in 2011 as  the world s biggest funder of terrorism  and asserted, not inaccurately, that it was using  our petro dollars   our very own money   to fund the terrorists that seek to destroy our people while the Saudis rely on us to protect them.  Once on the campaign trail, he upped the ante by declaring that the Saudis  blew up the World Trade Center  and threatened to block their oil if they didn t do more to fight ISIS Continue this story at Consortium NewsREAD MORE TRUMP NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire TRUMP FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV"

 Iowa Legislator Leaves Republican Party Over Trump’s Racism,"For almost an entire year Donald Trump insulted, berated, bastardized and scrutinized everything that wasn t a white, Christian male. Republicans barely flinched.Then he makes a comment about a Mexican judge s heritage when it pertains to his fraud lawsuit. Republicans lose their minds (and rightfully so).It appears that Trump s comments about Judge Gonzalo Curiel has hit a special nerve in one state legislator.The Des Moines Register has broken the news that David Johnson, who has served in the Iowa General Assembly for 18 years as a Republican, will be leaving the GOP over the party s  bigot  nominee, Donald J. Trump.Johnson told the Register: I will not stand silent if the party of Lincoln and the end of slavery buckles under the racial bias of a bigot. The now former Republican will be registering as a member of  no party preference,  and said he will never support Hillary Clinton for president. However, Johnson has also stated that he is not sure he will caucus with the Republicans in the Legislature, feeling that members of the GOP have become  too timid  to take on Trump and his supporters. Johnson did say that if a formidable Republican steps up to the plate and challenged Trump nationally, he may rejoin the party, but said: If Mr. Trump is the nominee, he becomes the standard bearer for a party that s on the verge of breaking apart. He simply cannot unify the GOP. If there is a profound split, I ll gladly rejoin Republicans who are dedicated to equality and justice for all, and let Trump lead his supporters over the cliff. And that s exactly what Mr. Trump will do. Johnson also knows how this will hurt him politically, but says he doesn t care, citing his record of often going against the Republican establishment in the state when it comes to education funding and Medicaid program.One thing is for sure   we will see many more Republicans follow Johnson s lead in he coming months.Featured image via Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images"
IF HILLARY AND BERNIE Are Counting On The Cuban Vote…They’re Making A BIG Mistake…Here’s Why…,"The Cuban vote is a conservative vote so Hillary and Bernie might want to steer clear.Every election cycle, media outlets beg the question of whether Miami s Little Havana will finally sway Democrat. After spending an afternoon in south Florida s most famous Cuban neighborhood, the prospect once again seems unlikely.Ahead of Florida s primary, Little Havana s Cuban-Americans are enthusiastic about a local figure with similar life experience in Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla). But they still hold the value of a GOP nominee over any individual candidate.Brenda Betancourt, a notary public at the Calle Ocho Chamber of Commerce who paints on t-shirts and canvases in her spare time, told Independent Journal Review she voted early for Rubio, saying,  we prefer somebody that we know than a stranger. She added that she has never once cast a vote for a Democrat because the party s platforms are counterintuitive to the American experience: I will not vote for either Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders. I don t think that giving everything away without the person working is in the American dream. I think everybody has to work and earn what they need.  Read more: injo "
BOEHNER ANNOUNCES HIS FINAL ACT OF COWARDICE As He Steps Down Before Being Ousted As Speaker,"In his final act of putting Americans dead last, John Boehner will stand with Democrats in their rabid desire to keep the abortion industry humming. Because government funding for baby part harvesting businesses is exactly where American taxpayers want to see their hard earned money being spent. Well done John .U.S. House Speaker John Boehner vowed on Sunday that Congress will avoid a government shutdown this week and he would push through as much unfinished legislation as possible before leaving at the end of October.Speaking on CBS  Face the Nation two days after his surprise resignation, he said the House this week would pass a government funding bill now moving through the Senate, which does not meet conservatives  demands to cut off money for Planned Parenthood.Asked if passage would require Democratic votes, he responded:  I m sure it will, but I suspect my Democratic colleagues want to keep the government open as much as I do. Boehner resigned amid deep divisions among House Republicans over a range of issues including the handling of a Sept. 30 deadline to approve new funding for federal agencies and programs from education to national parks.Conservative Republicans, some of whom have called for his ouster, have insisted on punishing Planned Parenthood by withholding funds over allegations that the non-profit group improperly sold tissues harvested from aborted fetuses.But Boehner and more moderate Republicans have argued that such a move would not halt the bulk of the group s $500 billion in funding, which comes from reimbursements through the Medicaid healthcare program for the poor.

"CATHOLICS SHOULD BE Singing Donald Trump’s Praises After He Boldly Defended Life, While Hillary Was Forced To Admit Support For Barbaric Partial-Birth Abortion","Rush Limbaugh was cheering for Trump and how he handled the abortion question that was asked in last night s debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump. Do Catholics and other pro-life groups truly understand the significance of this election? Do they know how many Supreme Court Justices our next President will likely replace in the next 4 years? In addition to the abortion issue, our religious freedoms are at serious risk. The Left has been attacking Christianity and Judaism for years, while protecting the Muslim faith like their lives depend on it. Rush mentioned on his radio show today how shocked he was by Trump s unabashed support for the life of the unborn. He said that there has never been a presidential candidate in history who has so bravely stood up for life during a debate with the Democrat opponent, like Donald J. Trump did last night. Here is his brilliant analysis Rush: Let me ask you a question. When Chris Wallace asked this abortion question, did you people start cringing?  Oh, no, jeez, every time this comes up we get smoked, oh, my God.  And he turned it to partial-birth abortion on a dime, which was either brilliant or instinctive or combination of the two, because she had no defense for what he was alleging, and she didn t even try. Her only defense, when he brought up,  They want rip babies out of the womb a day before they re born, a week before they re born. And she doesn t deny it. All she can say is,  I have seen these women. I have met these women, and I m telling you it is one of the hardest things, I m telling you it is one of the most difficult things.  She s therefore on record as supporting partial-birth abortion last night. I will guarantee you that s the last thing anybody on the Democrat Party side ever factored would happen. That s why she wasn t prepared for it.And it was, I don t know, as I say, either brilliant or instinctive or a combination of the two, but to take that question on abortion, which has traditionally been a nail in the coffin for a Republican candidate, turn that around to a winning issue for him, a losing issue for her, and you ll note that nobody in the Drive-Bys is talking about that exchange. They don t want to go anywhere near it.And then she lied about Planned Parenthood and all these mammograms they do and all these precancer checks. They don t do a single mammogram, folks. They do not do them. They don t do checks for cancer. Their solution to everything at Planned Parenthood is an abortion. She lied through her teeth. I don t know if Trump knows that or not. Most people who,  Oh, great work, mammograms, care for women.  They don t do anything of the sort. They harvest baby parts and sell them! We now know that.But the partial-birth abortion thing, he turned it around on her. She didn t have a denial and the Drive-Bys aren t talking about it, and it s things like that in a debate you ll never hear any public reaction, no polling on it, but could have a huge impact. We ll never know. We won t know until the elections.   Via: Rushlimbaugh.com"

WATCH: HOLLYWOOD ACTOR SCOTT BAIO…All In For TRUMP: ‘We Need Somebody to Relentlessly Attack Hillary’,"Add one more name to the growing list of celebrities who are brave enough to speak out and risk their careers for the sake their country.Scott Baio has added his name to the list of celebrities who are getting behind Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump.The actor revealed his endorsement of Trump to Fox News  Judge Jeanine Pirro on Saturday, calling himself  fed up  with the Republican party. When asked why he supports Trump, Baio, who identifies as a conservative independent, said Trump  communicates with people very well. https://youtu.be/Yxv7rEnf-a0 It s very simple, because when he speaks I understand him,  Baio said.  He speaks like I speak, he communicates with people very well. I want him, as any one person can do, to go into Washington and blow it up. The  Charlies in Charge,   Happy Days  and  Joanie Loves Chachi  actor went on to say that the right needs someone to  relentlessly  take on democrat Hillary Clinton. They re going to attack whomever the Republican nominee is,  he said.  We need somebody to relentlessly, relentlessly attack Hillary. It s the only way we re going to win. I m trying to be a classy guy, but to win elections nowadays, the Democrats and liberals attack viciously. Baio also slammed the Republican party, telling Pirro that it  lie and conned and B.S.ed  him. He s only the latest celebrity voicing support for Trump, joining Ted Nugent, Jon Voight, Kid Rock, Aaron Carter, Willie Robertson and Stephen Baldwin. Meanwhile, stars including Johnny Depp and Louis C.K. have spoken out against him. Via: Variety"
" Shortly Before Her Death, Nancy Reagan Said She Was Ashamed Of The GOP (VIDEO)","On Sunday, the nation learned that former first lady Nancy Reagan, 94, had passed away at her Los Angeles home from congestive heart failure. Nancy was the wife of Republican hero Ronald Reagan and after his death in 2004, she became an outspoken activist for a cure Alzheimer s disease and huge beacon of support for families whose loved ones suffered from the degenerative illness. While Republican presidential candidates have expressed grief over her passing, her longtime friend, Larry King, said he is relieved that she will not be here to see the end of the GOP s disgusting presidential race.During an interview with CNN s Wolf Blitzer, King said: I ll miss her. I love socializing with her, I love gossiping with her, I love talking with her. If there s one thing glad about this,  he added.  She isn t around to see the end of this political year. Because she was very upset by it. We can understand why she would be upset. The candidates running for the Republican nomination have constantly tried to equate themselves with her husband. Even though a number of his children have spoken out and said that Reagan would be appalled by the comparisons.While these candidates, like Ted Cruz and (shudder) Donald Trump, name drop the former president during every GOP debate, they behave like schoolyard bullies and pledge to never compromise with Democrats. Reagan may have had faults (A LOT of them) but he knew how to compromise and he never, ever behaved the way the current Republican Party does.As a matter of fact, if Ronald Reagan was a candidate in this race, the others running would probably call him a RINO and a traitor. And they damn sure wouldn t support any amnesty plan for undocumented immigrants (like the one he is well-known for).The current GOP is so gross that when news of Nancy s passing spread, their voters took it as on opportunity to attack the current first lady, Michelle Obama.With all of this, is it really any wonder she was upset?Watch:https://youtu.be/TZUVIbWbT2w Featured image via video screenshot"
 Man Who Pulled Glock On Portland Protesters Was Armed With Five Magazines Of Ammo (VIDEO),"Michael Strickland, 36, was arrested after pulling a handgun on Black Lives Matter protesters in Portland, Oregon, Thursday night. Video of the incident shows Strickland pulling what appears to be a Glock 26 on protesters who were demonstrating against the recent fatal shootings of black men by police officers. It was revealed that the gun owner had a round in the chamber and five other magazines of ammunition of him while aiming the gun at the anti-police brutality group, according to court records.Strickland is accused of two counts of unlawful use of a firearm, menacing and second- degree disorderly conduct, according to The Oregonian.Multnomah County deputy district attorney Kate Molina Friday successfully argued for Strickland s bail to be set at $250,000 after two felony counts of unlawful use of a firearm were added to misdemeanor allegations of menacing and second-degree disorderly conduct.Strickland had an extended clip in his firearm that he swept at chest level multiple times in front of the demonstrators. The gun owner also waved it in front of a plain-clothed Portland police officer.Portland Officer Branden L. Combs was in Chapman Square during the protest and heard people running by him yelling,  Gun! Gun!  and  He s got a gun,  according to a probable cause affidavit.Police were told by one of the protesters that Strickland has tried to  incite or instigate others  at different demonstrations.Officer Combs witnessed the incident. He was standing just about 20 to 25 yards away from Strickland when he went all Second Amendment on the protestestors, sweeping the crowd with his firearm.After the arrest, police found an extended clip in Strickland s handgun, a round in the chamber of the gun, plus two magazines of ammunition in a belt pouch, two magazines in one of his pants pockets and one magazine in the other, Molina said. In addition, he also had a pocket knife in his right front pants pocket.According to Strickland s attorney Chris Trotter, his client was a journalist who has a concealed carry permit, adding that he  has every right to protect himself.  Trotter alleged that the District Attorney s office was  making an example  of Strickland.Molina responded, saying that  Given that Mr. Strickland pulled a gun on a crowd of people in front of the steps of the Justice Center  and has a past police report alleging  possibly race-based threats  against an attendee at a Portland vigil for the victims of last month s Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida, his client s bail set at $250,000 is justified.From the video, it looks like Strickland aimed his Glock at a man who is armed with only a camera.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvV3BQ-RoJw]In a separate incident, a white male showed up at a memorial for Alton Sterling, the black Louisiana man who was fatally shot by police officers.Hey guys, you re doing the Second Amendment wrong.Image via screen capture.

 Golf Addicted 70-Year-Old Man Says He ‘Couldn’t Care Less About Golf’,"Just as drug addicts and alcoholics tend to be in denial of their disease, former reality show star Donald Trump does not think he has a problem. The alleged president has not addressed opioid addiction which is sweeping across the U.S., and that s probably because he, too, suffers from a type of addiction and remains in denial. Donald Trump needs treatment, but that would mean he d have to take a leave of absence from his job.The amateur president has spent 31 days of his time in office visiting at least one of his properties, including 19 visits to his golf clubs. He s been on the job for only 100 days. In contrast, former President Barack Obama only hit the golf course once during the same amount of time in office. Obama s first golf game was on April 26th, 2009.Still yet, as addicts do, Trump defended his frequent weekend trips to his luxury resort and properties, saying he does not care about golfing as much as people might think he does, according to The Hill. I have a lot of property. So if I go to my clubs like in New Jersey, they ll say,  Oh he is going to play golf.  I am not going to play golf,  Trump said in an interview on Fox News.  I couldn t care less about golf. Well, he sure did care when Obama played golf, though. In fact, there are dozens of rage-tweets from Trump about Obama playing golf.Can you believe that,with all of the problems and difficulties facing the U.S., President Obama spent the day playing golf.Worse than Carter  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2014 But I have a place there that costs almost nothing because its hundreds of acres and security and they don t have to close up streets,  Trump added.What Trump means is that it costs him  nothing.  We, the taxpayers, though, are paying big time. It costs us about $3 million a pop every time he visits his Mar-a-Lago resort. Meanwhile, every visit to a Trump-owned property promotes it and that means there s a conflict of interest as he profits from the presidency.Trump did say that he feels  a little guilty  going back to his Trump Tower residence in New York because of all the expenses that are associated with each trip. But, he didn t mention the costs to taxpayers having to foot the bill for having several White Houses, instead of one. For example, the security for Melania Trump in New York reportedly costs the city s Police Department between $127,000 and $146,000 a day to protect her and her son. The Secret Service had to request an additional $60 million in funding to protect Trump and his family. I love New York, but going back is very expensive for the country because they close up Fifth Avenue and they close up 56th Street   and I always feel a little bit guilty when I go there,  he said.Trump said he does not want to be perceived as  lazy  but noted that he prefers to visit his other properties because they are not as expensive to secure. They are expensive to secure. Trump s frequent visits to his Florida resort have been a financial burden on the county. It would be much better if people would understand that I could go other places that I have,  Trump said.  But then they hit me for relaxing. And I don t want to be known as a person that relaxes because I am working hard and I am working hard for the people. Addiction, whether it be from drugs, alcohol, sex or golfing, is not a prejudiced disease. It can affect you whether you are black, white, Orange, rich or poor, pay your taxes, or if you try to hide your taxes from the public because you pay nothing at all.Photo by Ian MacNicol/Getty Images."

"CAN YOU HEAR HIM NOW? President Trump Doubles Down: Condemns ‘Evil’ KKK, White Supremacists, Neo-Nazis [Video and Transcript]","President Trump condemned hate groups today AGAIN! Yes, it seems the left didn t hear the president the first time around. They needed their own special speech but they ll still find something to complain about. Allowing Trump to be a good guy just doesn t fit their narrative. No matter how beautiful the speech was today, the Democrats will continue the rhetoric against Trump The last thing they want is a united America THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. I m in Washington today to meet with my economic team about trade policy and major tax cuts and reform. We are renegotiating trade deals and making them good for the American worker. And it s about time.Our economy is now strong. The stock market continues to hit record highs, unemployment is at a 16-year low, and businesses are more optimistic than ever before. Companies are moving back to the United States and bringing many thousands of jobs with them. We have already created over one million jobs since I took office.We will be discussing economic issues in greater detail later this afternoon, but, based on the events that took place over the weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia, I would like to provide the nation with an update on the ongoing federal response to the horrific attack and violence that was witnessed by everyone.I just met with FBI Director Christopher Wray and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The Department of Justice has opened a civil rights investigation into the deadly car attack that killed one innocent American and wounded 20 others. To anyone who acted criminally in this weekend s racist violence, you will be held fully accountable. Justice will be delivered.As I said on Saturday, we condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence. It has no place in America.And as I have said many times before: No matter the color of our skin, we all live under the same laws, we all salute the same great flag, and we are all made by the same almighty God. We must love each other, show affection for each other, and unite together in condemnation of hatred, bigotry, and violence. We must rediscover the bonds of love and loyalty that bring us together as Americans.Racism is evil. And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.We are a nation founded on the truth that all of us are created equal. We are equal in the eyes of our Creator. We are equal under the law. And we are equal under our Constitution. Those who spread violence in the name of bigotry strike at the very core of America.Two days ago, a young American woman, Heather Heyer, was tragically killed. Her death fills us with grief, and we send her family our thoughts, our prayers, and our love.We also mourn the two Virginia state troopers who died in service to their community, their commonwealth, and their country. Troopers Jay Cullen and Burke Bates exemplify the very best of America, and our hearts go out to their families, their friends, and every member of American law enforcement.These three fallen Americans embody the goodness and decency of our nation. In times such as these, America has always shown its true character: responding to hate with love, division with unity, and violence with an unwavering resolve for justice.As a candidate, I promised to restore law and order to our country, and our federal law enforcement agencies are following through on that pledge. We will spare no resource in fighting so that every American child can grow up free from violence and fear.

" Tired Of Things Going Well, Marco Rubio Makes Promise To Destroy America Again (VIDEO)","Listening to several of the Republican candidates for president, one could wonder if they ve been in a cryogenic sleep for the past seven years, and they re still talking about how badly George W. Bush screwed things up. However, no, they keep repeating the lie that the nation is so much worse now than it was at the brink of a recession before President Obama took over. Republican voters should honestly be insulted by this, being treated like idiots absent from reality. Although, maybe they are idiots absent to reality, and these Republican candidates are just being opportunistic.Repeating this lie of  seven disastrous years  of Obama, Marco Rubio took to the media branch of the GOP, Fox News, to give a quick campaign message and offer his well wishes for the new year. Hi, this is Marco Rubio, a senator from Florida, and a candidate for President of the United States. As we leave 2015 behind and look forward to 2016, with the elections that are coming up in November, this is the year where we re going to have a chance to turn America around. After seven disastrous years of the current president, we have a chance to reclaim the American dream, and that s why I m running for president. And my resolution for 2016 is to do everything I can to not just restore the American dream, but to expand it to reach more people and change more lives than ever before. So that this, the greatest country in the world, can be greater than it s ever been. So, what America does Rubio want to go back to, exactly? One where people are losing their homes? One where jobs are lost at a rate of 750,000 per month? One where people could be denied healthcare for a preexisting condition? One where the 14th amendment is ignored and marriage equality doesn t exist? One where Osama bin Laden is still alive? One where credit card companies can still screw customers over left and right?Honestly, what does Rubio want to do to  turn America around,  because it sure as hell looks as though we are headed in the right direction, and if anything could stand a candidate to continue Obama s progress and advance it further.Rubio apparently wants an America where Wall Street runs the show, people die or go bankrupt from lack of health coverage, and Americans aren t treated equally under the law. So, if that s the America Rubio wants   thanks, but no thanks. .@marcorubio:  This is the year where we re going to have a chance to turn America around.  #FoxNews2016 https://t.co/yvze0WpCKg  Fox News (@FoxNews) January 1, 2016 Video/Featured image: Twitter"
BIG MISTAKE! HILLARY JUST Proved To America She’s Committed To Keeping Obama’s Divisive Race War Going,"Dividing America will be Obama s legacy. Hillary continues to prove that she is committed to keeping his legacy of hate and division alive. What Hillary doesn t get is that the majority of Americans are not buying into Obama s divisive legacy that pits gays against straight people, Blacks against Whites, everyone against Christians and so on The reason Donald J.Trump is so popular, is that he conveys a feeling of love for our country and gives Americans the sense that he cares passionately about putting an end to the manufactured division and hate that Obama has spent the last 8 years creating.You may get a lot of retweets and likes from paid trolls and social justice warriors on Twitter Hillary, but your message of division is not going to play well at the polls with the general public who are 100% FED UP with divisive politics on November 8th Keith Lamont Scott. Terence Crutcher. Too many others. This has got to end. -H  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 21, 2016"
HEAD GAMES: Technology With The Potential To Shape Reality,"Randy Johnson 21st Century Wire  MIRROR MIRROR   Am I still just a movie concept?  Virtual  avatar  technology is in its infancy   as far as we know (Image: Actor Sam Worthington from the science fiction blockbuster film, Avatar).Is humanity s recent quantum leap with technology all fun and games, or a zombie-like march into the arms of a technocratic prison world?For generations we have seen global figures such as John F. Kennedy or Ronald Reagan speak on television and that s what we believed we have seen and heard.We have all heard, people say things such as  The President said it   it was on the news  or  she said it on TV, I saw it.  Ever since the invention of the medium of television, this has served as a sufficient casual reference to any event away from the local area.What if the words and image of a global figure, broadcast to millions on television, was not real?  What if your eyes and ears where literally deceiving you?Simply put, what if seeing isn t believing anymore?  What if the person on screen, on LIVE television, who is actually interacting with questions asked, was not the person being represented on screen?With technological advancements, as exemplified with the  still-in-development Face2Face system, the potential to present and act any person to an audience for multiple reasons, both good and bad, is here.  With respect to black budgets, exotic technology, and unknown classified advancements of similar computer systems and programs   technology beyond that of the Face2Face system could already be here and further advanced.What exactly is a Face2Face system?  TechCrunch.com describes it as taking,  A YouTube video of someone speaking like, say, George W. Bush.  Use a standard RGB [Red Green Blue] webcam to capture a video of someone else emoting and saying something entirely different.  Throw both videos into the Face2Face system and  you ve now got a relatively believable video of George W. Bush s face   now almost entirely synthesized   doing whatever the actor in the second video wanted the target s face to do. If the definition eludes you, then take a look at the Face2Face system in action.Watch below as life-like avatars of George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Vladimir Putin follow visual commands in real time via the Face2Face system. That s great.  What about the voice you might ask?It does not take a wild imagination to envision voice software programs linked up with visual avatars for something like the Face2Face system in real time.Celebrity  voice changer  technology or other  voice morphing  software is already available at the consumer level.  Many security systems, phones, and buildings grant access by authenticating a person s voice.  There is even a real danger for people to have their actual voice  hacked  as they leave samples of it everywhere throughout the day.If the Face2Face technology, in a development stage as seen above, as does voice changing and voice recognition technology exists, then it only follows that the audio and the visual technology are destined to sync up.Just think of the implications.You could potentially have John Wayne, Elvis, Michael Jordan, Osama bin Laden, Miley Cyrus, or Justin Beiber wishing you happy birthday on a video message and interacting with you   Live.  It isn t really them, but then again it is them, just in a virtual reality sort of way.  Could there eventually be monetary charges to use the likeness of famous people dead or alive with certain companies owning certain celebrity s long dead and families of recent celebrities getting a cut?Perhaps a world leader could be dead for weeks and still delivering speeches or issuing orders. Anyone can be misquoted intentionally and questioned, framed, or made to fall from grace in the court of public opinion.  If you could take over another nation s airwaves, their leader can be seen saying something they said on television   except for the fact it isn t them and they never said it. Wars have been started for less.In the summer of 2015, 21WIRE discussed the use of a 3D avatar in the political realm, as India s Prime Minister Narendra Mohdi delivered a holographic speech at some 900 different rallies over the course of his campaign: Some would argue politicians are actors or entertainers in their own right, but hologram use is not limited to entertainers. Narendra Mohdi has already used the technology during his successful campaign to become India s Prime Minister. What would the future of electioneering look like with this new high-tech gadgetry?It has long been known that US political strategists have shaped elections throughout the world.In 2015, Hollywood released a fictionalized political comedy-drama named after a documentary called Our Brand Is Crisis (2005), a picture which gave a behind-the-scenes account of how James Carville and the political consultancy Greenberg Carville Shrum (GCS) socially-engineered the 2002 Bolivian elections to help Gonzalo S nchez de Lozada win the heavily contested presidency. He eventually resigned due to the so-called  Gas Wars,  where it was announced that he would follow pro-US economic policies and export natural gas to the US and Mexico.The documentary displays much of the socially-engineered electioneering that has been ongoing by the West for decades   it makes you wonder what future Western-backed campaigns might look like when aided by new tech, such as Spain s recent holographic protests, that featured thousands marching in avatar form.  SOCK PUPPET PROTEST?    New forms of political control on the horizon. (Image Source: americansuburbx)Media platforms are used to manipulate.  The very images we see all sorts of screens and media platforms can be planned, created, and manipulated through the use of actors, sets, and computer graphics.So technology doesn t have an effect on the masses and is rolled out to society  without a blueprint  so to speak?  Just consider the now common scene below.  NOMOPHOBIA    Technology, consumerism, and human behavior together.  So close, yet so far away   (Image Source: mymimtimsum.blogspot.com)Mass media in particular, is often utilized to shape opinions, drive agendas, and to communicate messages to the masses.  This is nothing new and can be as mundane as with advertising and marketing.  Specialized fields such as consumer psychologists and behavioral scientists became part of marketing teams and campaigns.  Corporations within the United States, China, United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan spent over 590 billion dollars on advertising in 2015.  In so many words, shaping masses in various aspects of behavior is literally seen as a science.Is mainstream  news reporting  above the fray and simply covering events?  Is shaping minds and creating trends limited to marketing and mass commercialism?  Probably not.  It is now becoming common knowledge that 6 umbrella corporations own about 90% of the media.  If you steer the minds, shape the laws, and build the consensus, you control the profits and get to select winners and losers.  The saying  The medium is the message seems as relevant as ever.Virtual Reality vs Old Fashioned Reality LAWNMOWER MAN  (left image)   In this 1992 science fiction film, drugs & virtual reality augment human intelligence. (Image Source: movpins)Virtual reality or deception is best brought in  through the front door  and accepted slowly via entertainment means.  Movies, televisions, computers, the internet, and smart phones are the norm and were presented to the masses as a means of entertainment, news, communication or learning, but have a dark side of conditioning, monitoring people, propaganda dissemination and changing or controlling human outlooks on reality.For those old enough to remember life before the year 2000, they might remember having human interaction that included interaction in close proximity to others.  Now, so-called social networking is something not done in person.  It s almost fashionable for someone to ignore their surroundings and introvert themselves into the world  of a device.Nothing beats connecting with other people more than losing oneself into the cyber reality of a smart phone   DIGITAL SLAVE    This is becoming a familiar sight.  When the conversation is this good, why go out?  (Image Source: Prezi.com)Fun and games, or a zombie-like walk into the arms of a technocratic world. The Face2Face system technology above is not unlike the virtual reality (VR) technology used to map a person s face and expressions to a VR avatar. Mark Zukerberg s Facebook has shown heavy interest in the technology, most notably with its 2 billion dollar purchase of Silicon Valley VR firm Oculus Rift.The global acquisitions of talent and start-up companies with expertise in virtual reality technology by Facebook has been notable and they have stated their intent to integrate social networking with virtual reality and avatars.Nothing beats getting people together and networking than a visual representation of themselves in a virtual reality scenario.Get with it!  Reality is so yesterday!   OCULUS RIFT   purchased by Facebook, can map and copy face movements in real time. It has vast potential for shaping reality via gaming and social networking.Ready or not, an ever-increasing technological world is on the way. Virtual reality devices are not likely to become common overnight. However, over time, especially for those who can remember, it will probably be like when there were no smart phones. Eventually humankind could reach a point where few remember what it was like without it.In addition to Face2Face types of technology, holographic and projection technology, as seen with  Face Hacking , could be intertwined with Face-2-Face and voice morphing technologies.Read 21st Century Wire s article Face Hacking: 3-D Projection Mapping in Real Time here.The potential can be as amazing as it is disconcerting.  In the meantime more and more people are warming up to the reality of a virtual reality.  Watch below. READ MORE A.I. TECHNOLOGY: 21st Century Wire A.I. Files"
OBAMA TO VISIT MOSQUE WHERE RADICAL IMAM Condones Suicide Bombings…Even MORE Unbelievable Is List Of Muslims Who Committed Horrific Acts Of Terror Against Americans Who Prayed There,"Our Imam In Chief told America he was a Christian when he wanted us to elect him in 2007. His Black Liberation Theology Pastor of hate later revealed that Barack only used the church as a way to boost his status as a community organizer. He s been openly mocking Christianity for years now and now, of all the mosques in America he feels compelled to visit, it just happens to be one with a radical Imam and ties to several terrorists who have committed atrocities against Americans.All is forgiven with ignorant liberals who believe terror organization CAIR, when they say Obama just wants to send a message of inclusion and mutual respect. President Obama is set to speak next week at a mosque which was led for over a decade by an Imam who justified suicide bombings in some circumstances and who helped found a mosque with ties to Al Qaeda.The President will visit the Islamic Society of Baltimore on Wednesday and deliver remarks there, the White House confirmed on Saturday. This will be the first time the President has paid an official visit to a mosque during his seven years as President. However, Obama has toured mosques while on overseas trips. The president believes that one of our nation s greatest strengths is our rich diversity,  White House spokesman Keith Maley said, confirming reports.  As the president has said, Muslim Americans are our friends, and neighbors; our co-workers, and sports heroes   and our men and women in uniform defending our country. The Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) which has been declared a terrorist organization in the United Arab Emirates and was named by federal prosecutors as an unindicted co-conspirator in the Holy Land Foundation s Hamas-funding operation welcomed Obama s decision. For a number of years we ve been encouraging the president to go to an American mosque,  said CAIR spokesman Ibrahim Hooper.  With the tremendous rise in anti-Muslim sentiment in our country, we believe that it will send a message of inclusion and mutual respect. But critics of Obama s decision may question his choice of the Islamic Society of Baltimore, where Mohamad Adam el-Sheikh, a native of Sudan and former member of the Muslim Brotherhood, led the institution for eighteen years as its Imam.Before becoming Imam there, el-Sheikh helped found the Muslim American Society, an outfit created by Muslim Brotherhood members.In 2004, he told the Washington Post, commenting on Palestinian suicide bombers:  If certain Muslims are to be cornered where they cannot defend themselves, except through these kinds of means, and their local religious leaders issued fatwas to permit that, then it becomes acceptable as an exceptional rule, but should not be taken as a principle. El-Sheikh also helped found the Dar Al-Hijrah mosque, which was once led by the deceased infamous Al Qaeda terrorist Anwar Al Awlaki.When he left the Islamic Society of Baltimore, El Sheikh became the Imam of Dar Al-Hijrah, following Awlaki s escape from the U.S. after the September 11 attacks.The Dar Al-Hijrah mosque was founded thanks, in part, to a large grant from Saudi Arabia s Embassy in the United States, which allowed for the large facility to accommodate some 5,000 Muslims.Dar Al-Hijrah, which is located right outside Washington, D.C., is connected to several high-profile Islamic terrorists who prayed there, including Major Nidal Hassan   the Ft. Hood massacre jihadi, two September 11 hijackers, and an unindicted co-conspirator in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.Via: Breitbart News"
SERIOUSLY? PRO-ILLEGAL ALIEN Supporters Demand Cops Explain Why They Can’t Physically Attack Trump Supporters [VIDEO],"The video begins with a clearly agitated pro-illegal alien female approaching Trump supporters. After a few of the agitators who were part of her group began to act in a hostile and threatening manner, police officers stepped in to form a barrier between the groups. The human barrier they formed was clearly not okay with the agitators who were looking to use physical force to shut up and shut down their opponents. Shortly after the police officer explained that the Trump supporters had a permit (which means nothing to people who have no regard for the law and are actually protesting on behalf of lawbreakers), another man who appears to be Hispanic, wearing a hoodie began to aggressively approach the crowd. We re not sure if these people were being paid to threaten the pro-Trump supporters or if they just happened to be angry supporters of illegal aliens, and were in the area.The Hispanic man on the pro-Trump side in the background, who was holding a  Deport Illegals  sign can be heard telling the pro-illegal agitators that he s  a legal American citizen  and he stands by President Trump. He hilariously follows up his comment with,  Homies for Trump.  The same man can be seen last night at a pro-Trump rally on Hollywood Blvd. prior to the Oscar Award ceremony in the video below where things did actually get violent and one obnoxious anti-Trump agitator got a surprise right hook from a pro-Trump woman after she was assaulted.Watch:Watch the video of the chaos that took place last night on Hollywood Blvd in Los Angeles just prior to the Oscar Award ceremony.

POCAHONTAS CALLS Trump’s Comments To Dem Senator Gillibrand “Slut-Shaming”…So Why Didn’t She Call Trump’s Comments About Romney During The Campaign “Slut-Shaming”? [VIDEO],"How quickly the Democrats and their allies in the media forget, that when the bear is poked, he fights back. Donald Trump has never been shy about punching back when he s being unfairly attacked, and Democrat Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (NY) is no exception. When she came after President Trump for allegations made by women for alleged sexual misconduct by then candidate-Trump, suggesting he should resign, Trump reminded everyone of how Gillibrand came to Trump, the former billionaire NYC business tycoon, begging him for campaign contributions.Here is Gillibrand s tweet calling for President Trump to either resign or threatening that Congress should investigate decades-old unfounded claims of sexual misconduct:President Trump should resign. But, of course, he won't hold himself accountable. Therefore, Congress should investigate the multiple sexual harassment and assault allegations against him.

He was begging for my endorsement,  Trump said at a rally later in Portland, Maine. I could ve said,  Mitt, drop to your knees.  He was begging me,  Trump said.Trump was referring to the 2012 race for president in which Romney, the GOP nominee that year, sought Trump s endorsement.But if they were friendly four years ago, that relationship has clearly deteriorated.Earlier Thursday, Romney gave a speech in which he railed against Trump, whom he called a  fraud,   con man,   phony,  and  fake,  among other things. His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University,  Romney jabbed.  He s playing the American public for suckers. He gets a free ride to the White House, and all we get is a lousy hat. Throughout Trump s subsequent speech in Maine, the real-estate developer repeatedly and extensively lashed back out at Romney. Mitt is a failed candidate   he failed badly,  Trump said.  That is a race that should have been won. He repeatedly called Romney a  choke artist  throughout the speech, an insult he s used against Marco Rubio, a top Trump rival for the 2016 nomination. He s a choke artist, I started hitting him so hard,  Trump said.  We can t take another loss. He choked, he choked like nobody I ve ever seen except for Rubio,  he continued.At other points in his speech, Trump called Romney a  disaster  candidate in 2012. The billionaire businessman then mentioned a fundraiser he held for Romney that  ruined  his carpet. Trump said Romney did not compensate him for the damages Senator Gillibrand was clearly not above cozying up to sexual predators for contributions or for leveraging their political clout.

 The Internet Rips Trump Adviser’s Face Off After Saying Sean Spicer Is Always ‘100 Percent Correct’,"Trump senior adviser Stephen Miller told ABC s This Week host George Stephanopoulos on Sunday that White House press secretary Sean Spicer is always  100 percent correct.  That s kind of weird since he literally fabricated a terrorist attack several times in order to defend Trump s Muslim ban. There is nothing Spicer won t lie about to defend the alleged president.Stephanopoulos said that Spicer mentioned  from the podium  that  the decision by Nordstrom to pull those products of Ivanka Trump was a direct attack on the president s policies  after the retailer pulled her clothing line due to poor sales.The ABC host noted that Sears and K-Mart decided this week to pull Trump s home furnishing lines from their websites. Is that a direct attack on the president s policies, as well?  Stephanopoulos asked. I m not going make a comment on that. I don t have any information on it,  Miller said.  I do want to say that Sean Spicer, as always, is 100 percent correct and that what he said is true and important. And I agree with it. He just said he has no knowledge of what happened but that Sean Spicer was correct. Welcome to the alternative-facts of the Trump administration. You had a case where somebody was treated unfairly. The president stuck up for a member of his family,  Miller continued.  And the White House counselor made a light-hearted, flippant comment that nobody would interpret as being what has been cast as right now by you and the media and others. The  flippant comment  Miller is referring to belongs to Kellyanne Conway in which she hawked Ivanka Trump s clothing line on the air while sitting in the briefing room.Watch: He also made a baseless claim about voter fraud which has been thoroughly debunked.Miller is trending on Twitter and he s being mocked over this crazy-time comments.I didn t realize Stephen Miller was a 12 year old boy.

BILL O’REILLY ASKS TRUMP “Racist” Question That Has Many Outraged…Was Bill Out-Of-Bounds This Time? [VIDEO],"Was O Reilly out-of-bounds? Most Americans would likely agree that we need to address the viability of employment opportunities for poorly educated Americans of every race who are walking around with multiple facial piercings and tattoos on their faces.Donald Trump appeared on The O Reilly Factor Monday night, but for once it wasn t the presidential candidate making headlines for his controversial remarks.Instead, it was Bill O Reilly himself who sparked fury after making statements about African-Americans that many called racist.During the interview, O Reilly pointed out that Trump is not polling well among minority voters, and questioned the Republican front-runner about his strategy for winning over black voters.Trump responded by saying he was doing  fantastic with African-Americans and with Hispanics  before launching into a speech about how the real issue was that jobs were being outsourced to countries like China and Mexico.O Reilly then pushed Trump to explain exactly how he could promise jobs to black voters, while offending many African-Americans at the same time. How are you going to get jobs for them?  O Reilly asked.  Many of them are ill-educated and have tattoos on their foreheads, and I hate to be generalized about it but it s true, if you look at all the educational statistics, how are you going to give jobs to people who aren t qualified for jobs?  Via: Daily MailBy the way Bill, there are no shortage of white people or Hispanics walking around with face tattoos. I m as sick as the next person of the excessive PC world we live in, but Bill s comments were pretty idiotic, has no basis and should be condemned. "

There is no greater honor for me, to have great men like you leading this country back to its foundation and back to God.

 SIX Witnesses Corroborate Sexual Assault Claim Made By ‘People’ Writer Against Trump,"Former People magazine writer Natasha Stoynoff has produced six witnesses who corroborate her allegations when she said Donald Trump was  pushing me against the wall and forcing his tongue down my throat. We walked into that room alone, and Trump shut the door behind us. I turned around, and within seconds he was pushing me against the wall and forcing his tongue down my throat,  she stated.Trump recently denied the story and later attacked Stoynoff while campaigning, saying,  She lies! Look at her, I don t think so. One of the witnesses is friend who was with Stoynoff when she ran into Melania Trump later in N.Y.C.Melania Trump is demanding a retraction and apology from People magazine, a move which surprises no one ever, especially since she previously threatened to sue bloggers for quoting from a source.The newest demand letter denies that Stoynoff and Melania ran into each other on the street that day. In states, in part,  The true facts are these: Mrs. Trump did not encounter Ms. Stoynoff on the street, nor have any conversation with her. Stoynoff s friend Liza Herz remembers the encounter. They chatted in a friendly way,  Herz says.  And what struck me most was that Melania was carrying a child and wearing heels. But, according to what Melania told  Anderson Cooper, that encounter never happened, saying, in part,  I was never friends with her, I would not recognize her. Stoynoff, though, was working on a profile of Melania s husband.People magazine reports:PEOPLE Editor in Chief Jess Cagle says in a statement about Stoynoff s piece,  In this week s issue of PEOPLE (which hits newsstands in New York on Wednesday), we feature a story that includes named sources who can corroborate Natasha Stoynoff s account   including one woman (a friend of Natasha s) who was actually with her when she bumped into Melania Trump on Fifth Ave., as outlined in her story. Five other witnesses also back up Stoynoff s account of her encounter with Trump.A longtime friend of Stoynoff s, Marina Grasic, said she got a phone call from her friend the day after the attack. During that call Stoynoff detailed everything about the assault.Grasic said Stoynoff felt embarrassed and even thought of Trump s then-pregnant wife Melania when deciding not to come forward about the incident. Natasha was also struggling about not hurting pregnant Melania if the story came out,  Grasic says.  Beyond just the attack, she was horrified by the vulgar circumstances under which she was attacked and propositioned to have an affair. She was there in a professional capacity, writing an article about their happy marriage, and after the incident Trump acted like nothing happened.

OBAMA RACES TO SET GITMO TERRORISTS FREE…Leaves Servicemen Punished For Making “Heat-of-the-battle decisions that saved lives” In Fort Leavenworth,"It s hard to imagine a President who could be more anti-American and more pro-terror than Barack Hussein Obama. And then my mind drifts to Hillary and Benghazi The Obama administration is emptying the military s Guantanamo Bay detention facility of avowed terrorists captured fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq, but several American service members languish in another military prison for actions on those same battlefields that their supporters say merit clemency, if not gratitude.Among the prison population at Fort Leavenworth, in Kansas, are remaining members of the so-called  Leavenworth 10,  convicted service members doing terms ranging from 10 to 40 years for heat-of-the-battle decisions their supporters say saved American lives.[quote_box_center] The very people who protect our freedoms and liberties are having their own freedoms and liberties taken away,  said retired U.S. Army Col. Allen West, a former congressman and political commentator.  I think it s appalling and no one is talking about this issue. [/quote_box_center]The  Leavenworth 10  is the name given to a fluctuating number of men housed at Leavenworth for actions in Iraq and Afghanistan that their supporters say were justified. Over the years, a handful have been paroled, and more have been incarcerated.Among the more well-known cases is that of Army First Lt. Clint Lorance, who is serving a 20-year sentence for ordering his men to shoot two suspected Taliban scouts in July 2012 in the Kandahar Province of Afghanistan. Lorance had just taken command of the platoon after the prior leader and several others were killed days before. The Taliban suspects were on motorcycles and matched descriptions given by a pilot who flew over the area earlier and spotted them as scouts.A Facebook page devoted to Lorance s case has drawn more than 12,000 likes, and supporters have launched a website, FreeClintLorance.com, dedicated to winning his release. A WhiteHouse.gov petition calling for Lorance to be pardoned garnered nearly 125,000 signatures, but the White House has not taken action.Critics say Lorance was given a military trial, and his conviction was based in large part on the testimony of men serving under him.It was September of 2010 when Sgt. Derrick Miller of Maryland, on a combat mission in a Taliban-held area of Afghanistan, was warned the unit s base had been penetrated. An Afghan suspected of being an enemy combatant was brought to Miller for interrogation and wound up dead. Miller claimed the suspect tried to grab his gun and that he shot him in self-defense. But he was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.U.S. Army Master Sgt. John Hatley   a highly decorated, 20-year vet who served in Operation Desert Storm and did another three tours during the Iraq War   also is serving a life sentence at Leavenworth. His conviction stems from an April, 2007, incident in Iraq in which he and his unit captured enemies following a firefight. He radioed a U.S. detention facility to notify officials he was bringing in four prisoners, but was ordered to let them go, according to his legal team.Two years later, a sergeant who had served with Hatley, Jesse Cunningham, was facing charges for assaulting another officer and falling asleep at his post. As leverage for a plea deal, he told investigators that Hatley and two other officers had taken the insurgents to a remote location, blindfolded them and shot each in the back of the head. He claimed their bodies were dumped in a canal, though none was ever found.Hatley, now 47, insists he and his men let the insurgents go, but believes he was punished in the interest of the government s relations with Baghdad. When concerns over appeasing a foreign country are allowed to interfere with justice for the purpose of the U.S. government or the military demonstrating that we, the military or the U.S. government will hold our soldiers accountable using a fatally flawed military judicial system, it doesn t matter what the truth is; it matters only that there is only the appearance of the truth,  he wrote in a message to supporters posted on freeJohnHatley.com.Law experts say military service members face a daunting task once accused of committing crimes in the heat of war. Killing on the battlefield is not the same as [a police officer] killing someone on the streets,  Dan Conway, an attorney who specializes in military law, told FoxNews.com.  When a cop uses force, there s a line of duty investigation. When a soldier uses force, it is investigated as criminal, and non-infantry investigators handle the case, many who have no combat experience. If you had experts handling the investigation, you d have much more balance,  he added.While the military rightly holds its soldiers to a high standard of justice, detainees housed at Guantanamo Bay have been freed even with no mitigating circumstances or reasonable belief of rehabilitation. The release of Gitmo detainees began during the presidency of George W. Bush in 2005 when nearly 200 detainees were released before any tribunals were held.According to a March 2015 memo released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, of the 647 detainees transferred or released, 17.9 percent were confirmed of re-engaging in extremist activity with another 10.7 percent suspected of doing the same.

WAS MICHELLE OBAMA In On Beyonce’s Cop-Hating Super Bowl Performance? [Video],"In an interview that is a tradition before the Super Bowl, the Obamas sat down with Oprah s BFF Gayle King to chitty chat about trivial things. Injecting politicians into the Super Bowl festivities has become more and more a normality. The Obamas have taken it to an all new level. It s to be expected but the real concern today is the question of whether Michelle Obama tipped her hat to the fact that she was in on the anti-American, cop-hating half-time performance by Beyonce. You be the judge:Michelle Obama s pre-game Super Bowl fluff interview revealed that she  cared deeply about the halftime show,  even coordinating her outfit for Beyonce s approval.President and Mrs. Obama sat down Sunday with  CBS This Morning  anchor Gayle King, a family friend, for what has become a tradition   a pre-Super Bowl interview.Sunday s performance was a far cry from the contentious exchange that occurred two years earlier with Fox News host Bill O Reilly. In fact, it was nothing short of a love fest that threatened to ruin the day for serious sports fans.Joined by the first lady for the first time, it was a given that the Obamas complained   about such things like bad Wi-Fi service at the White House   before discussing first dates and post-presidency plans, among other hard-hitting topics.The first lady said she cared  deeply about the halftime game show,  likely because pal Beyonc , one of this year s halftime performers, was planning to get political in support of Black Lives Matter. I got dressed for the halftime show,  Michelle said.  I hope Beyonc  likes what I ve got on. Mrs. Obama was dressed in all black, we assume in simpatico with the artist s dancers who performed in wardrobes that resembled the Black Panthers. The only thing missing was a Black Panther beret. Furious Americans are expressing their disappointment and outrage that the Super Bowl halftime show was allowed to be hijacked for political purposes and given a racist, black power theme.Read more: Biz Pac Review"
HOW PRESIDENT EISENHOWER Solved The Illegal Immigration Problem In America,"Since this article was written in 2006, the illegal immigration crisis in America has exploded. Barack Obama, his fellow Democrats, leftist organizations (and even some Republicans beholden to corporations who desire cheap labor in America), have desperately tried to shame Americans into accepting amnesty as the only option to solve this crisis. One doesn t have to look too far to see how miserably they have failed. Americans are not interested in giving up our jobs, our national security or the future of our country so the Democrat party can have a monopoly on voters, or to make it easier for business and corporations to hire cheap labor.  It is no accident that Donald Trump experienced a meteoric rise in the polls after he boldly proclaimed he would make building a wall on our southern border a priority. The media tried to shame him, only causing him to double down, claiming he would not only build the biggest and best wall on our southern border, but he claimed that Mexico would pay for it. This article is for all of the naysayers who believe the illegal immigration crisis can t be solved. The problem can be solved. We just needed a President with a backbone, who loves his country, is willing to take bold moves to secure our nation and most of all, a President who truly believes Americans come first.Over fifty years ago, when newly elected Dwight Eisenhower moved into the White House, America s southern frontier was as porous as a spaghetti sieve. As many as 3 million illegal migrants had walked and waded northward over a period of several years for jobs in California, Arizona, Texas, and points beyond.President Eisenhower cut off this illegal traffic. He did it quickly and decisively with only 1,075 United States Border Patrol agents   less than one-tenth of today s force. The operation is still highly praised among veterans of the Border Patrol.Although there is little to no record of this operation in Ike s official papers, one piece of historic evidence indicates how he felt. In 1951, Ike wrote a letter to Sen. William Fulbright (D) of Arkansas. The senator had just proposed that a special commission be created by Congress to examine unethical conduct by government officials who accepted gifts and favors in exchange for special treatment of private individuals.General Eisenhower, who was gearing up for his run for the presidency, said  Amen  to Senator Fulbright s proposal. He then quoted a report in The New York Times, highlighting one paragraph that said:  The rise in illegal border-crossing by Mexican  wetbacks  to a current rate of more than 1,000,000 cases a year has been accompanied by a curious relaxation in ethical standards extending all the way from the farmer-exploiters of this contraband labor to the highest levels of the Federal Government. Years later, the late Herbert Brownell Jr., Eisenhower s first attorney general, said in an interview with this writer that the president had a sense of urgency about illegal immigration when he took office.America  was faced with a breakdown in law enforcement on a very large scale,  Mr. Brownell said.  When I say large scale, I mean hundreds of thousands were coming in from Mexico [every year] without restraint. Although an on-and-off guest-worker program for Mexicans was operating at the time, farmers and ranchers in the Southwest had become dependent on an additional low-cost, docile, illegal labor force of up to 3 million, mostly Mexican, laborers.According to the Handbook of Texas Online, published by the University of Texas at Austin and the Texas State Historical Association, this illegal workforce had a severe impact on the wages of ordinary working Americans.The Handbook Online reports that a study by the President s Commission on Migratory Labor in Texas in 1950 found that cotton growers in the Rio Grande Valley, where most illegal aliens in Texas worked, paid wages that were  approximately half  the farm wages paid elsewhere in the state.Profits from illegal labor led to the kind of corruption that apparently worried Eisenhower. Joseph White, a retired 21-year veteran of the Border Patrol, says that in the early 1950s, some senior US officials overseeing immigration enforcement  had friends among the ranchers,  and agents  did not dare  arrest their illegal workers.Walt Edwards, who joined the Border Patrol in 1951, tells a similar story. He says:  When we caught illegal aliens on farms and ranches, the farmer or rancher would often call and complain [to officials in El Paso]. And depending on how politically connected they were, there would be political intervention. That is how we got into this mess we are in now. Bill Chambers, who worked for a combined 33 years for the Border Patrol and the then-called US Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), says politically powerful people are still fueling the flow of illegals.During the 1950s, however, this  Good Old Boy  system changed under Eisenhower   if only for about 10 years.In 1954, Ike appointed retired Gen. Joseph  Jumpin  Joe  Swing, a former West Point classmate and veteran of the 101st Airborne, as the new INS commissioner.Influential politicians, including Sen. Lyndon B. Johnson (D) of Texas and Sen. Pat McCarran (D) of Nevada, favored open borders, and were dead set against strong border enforcement, Brownell said. But General Swing s close connections to the president shielded him   and the Border Patrol   from meddling by powerful political and corporate interests.One of Swing s first decisive acts was to transfer certain entrenched immigration officials out of the border area to other regions of the country where their political connections with people such as Senator Johnson would have no effect.Then on June 17, 1954, what was called  Operation Wetback  began. Because political resistance was lower in California and Arizona, the roundup of aliens began there. Some 750 agents swept northward through agricultural areas with a goal of 1,000 apprehensions a day. By the end of July, over 50,000 aliens were caught in the two states. Another 488,000, fearing arrest, had fled the country.By mid-July, the crackdown extended northward into Utah, Nevada, and Idaho, and eastward to Texas.By September, 80,000 had been taken into custody in Texas, and an estimated 500,000 to 700,000 illegals had left the Lone Star State voluntarily.Unlike today, Mexicans caught in the roundup were not simply released at the border, where they could easily reenter the US. To discourage their return, Swing arranged for buses and trains to take many aliens deep within Mexico before being set free.Tens of thousands more were put aboard two hired ships, the Emancipation and the Mercurio. The ships ferried the aliens from Port Isabel, Texas, to Vera Cruz, Mexico, more than 500 miles south.The sea voyage was  a rough trip, and they did not like it,  says Don Coppock, who worked his way up from Border Patrolman in 1941 to eventually head the Border Patrol from 1960 to 1973.Mr. Coppock says he  cannot understand why [President] Bush let [today s] problem get away from him as it has. I guess it was his compassionate conservatism, and trying to please [Mexican President] Vincente Fox. There are now said to be 12 million to 20 million illegal aliens in the US. Of the Mexicans who live here, an estimated 85 percent are here illegally.Border Patrol vets offer tips on curbing illegal immigration One day in 1954, Border Patrol agent Walt Edwards picked up a newspaper in Big Spring, Texas, and saw some startling news. The government was launching an all-out drive to oust illegal aliens from the United States.The orders came straight from the top, where the new president, Dwight Eisenhower, had put a former West Point classmate, Gen. Joseph Swing, in charge of immigration enforcement.General Swing s fast-moving campaign soon secured America s borders   an accomplishment no other president has since equaled. Illegal migration had dropped 95 percent by the late 1950s.Several retired Border Patrol agents who took part in the 1950s effort, including Mr. Edwards, say much of what Swing did could be repeated today. Some say we cannot send 12 million illegals now in the United States back where they came from. Of course we can!  Edwards says.Donald Coppock, who headed the Patrol from 1960 to 1973, says that if Swing and Ike were still running immigration enforcement,  they d be on top of this in a minute. William Chambers, another  50s veteran, agrees.  They could do a pretty good job  sealing the border.Edwards says:  When we start enforcing the law, these various businesses are, on their own, going to replace their [illegal] workforce with a legal workforce. While Congress debates building a fence on the border, these veterans say other actions should have higher priority.1. End the current practice of taking captured Mexican aliens to the border and releasing them. Instead, deport them deep into Mexico, where return to the US would be more costly.2. Crack down hard on employers who hire illegals. Without jobs, the aliens won t come.3. End  catch and release  for non-Mexican aliens. It is common for illegal migrants not from Mexico to be set free after their arrest if they promise to appear later before a judge. Few show up.The Patrol veterans say enforcement could also be aided by a legalized guest- worker program that permits Mexicans to register in their country for temporary jobs in the US. Eisenhower s team ran such a program. It permitted up to 400,000 Mexicans a year to enter the US for various agriculture jobs that lasted for 12 to 52 weeks. Via: CS Monitor"
“BIKERS FOR TRUMP” Vow To Defend Trump During Inauguration Day…Plan Celebration! [Video], 
Son Of Egyptian Immigrants Hopes To Become FIRST MUSLIM GOVERNOR In U.S…Will Push For “Sanctuary State”,"Dr. Abdul El-Sayed, a liberal Democrat would like to become the nation s first Muslim Governor in a state that s home to the city of Dearborn, with the highest Muslim population outside of the Middle East. The state of Michigan also made news last year when Hamtramck, a city that for decades was known for it s strong Polish immigrant community, elected its first all-Muslim City Council. It s probably not that far-fetched that the son of Egyptian immigrants living in a state where tens of thousands of Muslim refugees and immigrants come to live would want to see the state of MI become a  Sanctuary State . My faith is really important to me, as it is for many Americans and Michiganders,  El-Sayed said.  But I think we should be asking ourselves rather than how one prays, or what they pray to, we should ask ourselves what [one] prays for and what one hopes for. While El-Sayed said his Islamic values are at the center of his work as a civil servant, he wants people to know his number one priority is to serve the people of Michigan.But some residents in the state may not be ready to see a Muslim governor. In the last several years, Michigan has been a hotbed of Islamophobia. Dearborn, a predominantly Arab-American city in the Detroit metro area, has been a frequent target of anti-Muslim activists, conspiracy theories and fake news. But El-Sayed doesn t want Michigan residents to be distracted by anti-Muslim rhetoric and violence   and he wants people to know that the principles of Islam are what guide his service. I am running because of the values my Islam teaches me   which includes beliefs in equity, the fundamental rights of all people, a belief that we will judge ourselves as a people based on how we treat the most vulnerable,  El-Sayed said.  A belief in being good to others fundamentally, a belief in respect and dignity to one s neighbors and one s friends and one s family. -Business InsiderDemocratic gubernatorial candidate Abdul El-Sayed is starting to propose a progressive platform that includes making Michigan a  sanctuary state,  providing universal preschool and offering publicly funded health insurance to any resident needing coverage.The ex-director of Detroit s health department unveiled parts of his platform Monday.I love it when the rule of law works #sanctuarycities https://t.co/3X4kJBu4WZ  Abdul El-Sayed (@AbdulElSayed) April 26, 2017El-Sayed claims that a Sanctuary State will make Michiganders safer. As a Michigander, I can assure you that making our state a  Sanctuary State  will not only make it less safe, but it will cause many people to move away to states who have laws against law-breakers.(3/3) if elected #gov my job is protecting #Michiganders, that's what #SanctuaryState will do.

US NewsEl-Sayed also made his feelings known on Twitter about a MI lawmaker, Rep. Michele Hoitenga, R-Manton,MI who wants to make Sharia Law illegal in that state of Michigan. El-Sayed attempts to make the comparison of the 10 commandments and the Holy Bible to Sharia Law. What El-Sayed seems to be willfully ignoring, is the fact that the United States is a Judeo-Christian nation.Nice try I oppose banning the #TenCommandments and #Bible   both came from the #MiddleEast. #religiousfreedom https://t.co/j7unpQSkiM  Abdul El-Sayed (@AbdulElSayed) April 20, 2017"
CHILLING: How America Looks After 8 Long Years With An Anti-American President,"The shocking truth about how close we are to becoming a one-party fascist stateThis is the most brilliant and scary analysis of where we, as a nation are today Last year a retired Border Patrol Officer by the name of Zach Taylor went on camera to explain the driving force behind the unprecedented surge in illegal immigration happening on our southern border. Taylor went on to note that what was happening at our border was not due to a spur of the moment event, or  a humanitarian crisis , but asymmetrical warfare. The surge we saw at the border was apart of a larger more chilling event that served one purpose and one purpose only, to show our enemies that our southern border had been compromised and the government wouldn t do a damn thing about it.The border was destroyed because of the actions taken by President Barack Obama under the guise of his Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) plan. Simply put, DACA rewrote our immigration laws and created the incentive for illegal aliens to break our laws as Obama deliberately undermined our nation s sovereignty by simply creating his own. The culmination of Obama s DACA has resulted in over 790,000 illegal aliens entering the country from the middle of 2013 to May of 2015, for a total of 2.5 million new illegal immigrants since Obama took office in January of 2009.While the threat comes from without, in this case millions of illegal immigrants, it could not have been possible without the enemy already being inside of the United States. As Mr. Taylor states,  If asymmetrical warfare is going to be successful, the first thing that has to be done is to compromise America s defense against invasion because they have to have their personnel inside the United States to affect the infrastructure   our hospitals, our schools, our electric grid, our power supplies, our water supply   basically what we call infrastructure [which] effects the degeneration from inside the United States.  By drawing away the resources that are intended to protect the United States border in order to care for the illegal immigrants, the border is now wide open and our infrastructure is overloaded. Yet, the  crisis on the border  is only a small part of the larger warfare that s being waged against our country at the hands of our own president. Today the Obama juggernaut is systematically bankrupting our country, and undoing the constitutional arrangements our Founders left to us , writes David Horowitz in his book Fight Fire With Fire. The contempt of the Obama party for consultative and representative government is relentlessly on display. Horowitz goes on to give the example of what our enemy represents with the following statement uttered by then Senate Majority leader Harry Reid as he defended his refusal to negotiate with Republicans over Obamacare and the debt crisis. Reid stated in these words:  We are here to support the federal government. That s our job.  End quote. You ll notice that representing the people for whom our Constitution makes sovereign is not included in Reid s statement.Horowitz then writes the following: My years as a radical prepared me to see much of this coming. But even I never thought we would be looking so soon at the prospect of a one-party system and a fascist state. Those words may sound hyperbolic, but take a moment to think about it. If you have transformed the taxing agency of the state into a political weapon   and Obama has; if you are setting up a massive government program to collect and file the financial and health information of every citizen, and also to control their access to care; and if you have a spy agency that can read the mail and listen to the communications of every individual in the country, you don t really need a secret police to destroy political opponents. You already have the means to do it. This is all the more troubling when you look at the sheer amount of data the Obama administration, or shall I say the Obama government, is collecting on each and every individual living in the United States. To effect the degeneration of the country from within the Obama administration has weaponized the IRS, DOJ, and FBI to target Americans who oppose their agenda. Now, the White House has added a key tool in their arsenal by prying into our most personal information at the most local levels, all for the purpose of  racial and economic justice.  On Saturday, Paul Sperry of the New York Post, uncovered the latest Obama plan that is aimed at collecting personal data for a secret race database. Sperry writes,  Unbeknown to most Americans, Obama s racial bean counters are furiously mining data on their health, home loans, credit cards, places of work, neighborhoods, even how their kids are disciplined in school   all to document  inequalities  between minorities and whites.  It may sound conspiratorial but under this government the only conspiracy is that being committed against Americans who are too distracted by today s latest ginned up political crisis.Sperry continues by noting that,  this Orwellian-style stockpile of statistics includes a vast and permanent network of discrimination databases, which Obama already is using to make  disparate impact  cases against: banks that don t make enough prime loans to minorities; schools that suspend too many blacks; cities that don t offer enough Section 8 and other low-income housing for minorities; and employers who turn down African-Americans for jobs due to criminal backgrounds. Big Brother Barack wants the databases operational before he leaves office, and much of the data in them will be posted online.  This means that so called civil-rights attorneys like those working for the ACLU and urban activist groups will be able to exploit them to show patterns of  racial disparities  and  segregation,  even if no other evidence of discrimination exists. Such databases have never before existed. Obama is presiding over the largest consolidation of personal data in US history. He is creating a diversity police state where government race cops and civil-rights lawyers will micromanage demographic outcomes in virtually every aspect of society , concludes Sperry. If you were to add all the databases created under this administration, including the Obamacare database, known as MIDAS, which retains tens of millions of Obamacare enrollees information, you could quiet literally make the claim that the federal government has data on every single American citizen. In the hands of someone like Obama this becomes of grave concern given his willingness to use such information against his opponents. Now that this information will be made public in order to extort communities deemed  too segregated . Whether it be through the withholding of federal funds for a local community showing a pattern of  racial disparity  or lawsuits against a school that disciplines minorities more than whites, it doesn t much matter. The government will be able to force you to act in a way that it deems socially acceptable as Obama drastically changes the racial makeup of America by enshrining an infrastructure that will continue long after he s gone.All the while this is happening below the surface and under the radar from most Americans, we remain and for good reason, distracted by the latest crisis of the day. A Christian owned Oregon bakery is forced by the state to pay a fine for not baking a cake for a lesbian couple, a woman is killed by an illegal immigrant and 7-time convicted felon in San Francisco, four Marines and one Navy Officer are executed by an Islamic jihadist; none of this would be happening but for Obama s actions. He knew that ISIS had put out a hit list specifically targeting our military, and he did nothing. He cheered on the Supreme Court ruling that legalized gay marriage knowing that it would be used in a way to exploit and destroy businesses specifically owned by Christians. He created the  sanctuary city  policy that has served to protect illegal immigrants while they rape, murder, and assault American citizens like Kate Steinle in San Francisco.All of this is happening because of the enemy we have in the White House. The country is being brought to its knees by overt acts such as the jihadist attack that was met with no response, to covert acts such as the Obama race database. Yet, no resistance is met to counter the agenda of the Obama adminstration. Even the capacity of the American people to determine their own national interests are being torn asunder without any fight, without even so much as a whimper from Congress. Without a pushback, the adminstration goes about acting without repercussion held to no degree of accountability. With impeachment and the power of the purse both taken off the table by Congress, America is literally at the whim of Obama as the only checks that exist today on what the president can do is what he personally thinks he can get away with and what his political incentives are.So the adminstration pushes full steam ahead without any concern for the American people themselves. Nowhere is this more apparent, on a foreign policy scale, than with the adminstration s nuclear deal with Iran. As Andrew McCarthy of National Review writes,  At the U.N. today, the Obama administration is colluding with our enemies and other foreign sovereigns to deprive the American people   through their elected representatives   of the power to determine what obligations they will accept under international law. The Obama administration has taken the position that Russia, China, and, yes, Iran, have a vote on our national security, but we do not. And in this betrayal, Congress has, at best, been a witless aider and abettor.  At worst, they ve gone along with the adminstration in committing treason against the United States of America.I believe in the latter.Via: Politically Short"
 MSNBC Host Can’t Help But Be Perfectly Sexist To Hillary Clinton After Her Big Night (TWEET),"Tuesday night was a very big night for Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton. The former Secretary of State had a clean sweep of wins across all five states that held primaries. These wins will help push her forward towards her path of securing the Democratic nomination for president.However, where there is the glory of being declared the victor, there will always be someone there to tear you down, and not just in a way coming from the opposition, but rather in weird unexpected ways. Such as, being told one is not celebrating properly. Which is exactly what MSNBC Morning Joe host Joe Scarborough did to Hillary Tuesday night.Apparently, according to Scarborough, HillaryClinton wasn t gleeful enough to his liking, and wasn t presenting herself in a way that he thought she should be on her victorious evening. If you watched Hillary s speech, she was, in fact very happy and gleeful, but apparently Scarborough thought differently. So, he told her to  smile. Smile. You just had a big night. #PrimaryDay  Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) March 16, 2016If Hillary never smiled for the rest of her life, guess what, that s perfectly fine. Scarborough has no right to tell a woman she needs to smile just because he thinks she should.Telling a woman to smile is ridiculously sexist. If you can t grasp that it is, that likely says more about you than it does about anyone else. Women shouldn t be required to smile at the drop of a hat just because someone thinks they should. If it s not required of men, why should it be of women? Not to mention the fact that it is SO annoying. Women, and I speak for myself as someone who has been told to smile regularly, are, quite frankly, tired of it.However, leave it to Samantha Bee to let him know that it s perfectly okay for a woman not to smile all the frickin  time..@JoeNBC pic.twitter.com/YZHVIKxE8O  Full Frontal (@FullFrontalSamB) March 16, 2016Which is also how women should look at Joe Scarborough from now on.Featured image via Instagram"
 Veterans SHRED Trump For Exploiting Navy SEAL’s Death While Press FAWNS All Over Him For It,"Trump s address to a joint session of Congress last night was long on old and tired talking points, and short on substance and concrete plans. Many lawmakers present had invited guests, and, of course, Trump invited his own guests, too, which presidents do. One of his guests was Carryn Owens, wife of slain Navy SEAL Ryan Owens, who was lost during the botched raid in Yemen.The press fawned all over Trump for that, talking about the emotional, touching moment in which Trump actually became presidential. Then there were veterans on social media who felt differently. Many feel that Trump did nothing but exploit Ms. Owens, her grief, and the death of her husband. They were quite clear in how they saw it:       Then there s U.S. Army veteran Charles Clymer, who was so livid he went on a mini-tweetstorm about it:      But here s the press  reaction. The fawning is gag-inducing, especially  from those who routinely speak out against Trump.         That s a stark difference. Trump used Ms. Owens like he always uses people. He was trying to puff himself up, score points, and distract attention from the poorly-planned and executed Yemen raid, which even DHS says yielded no useful intelligence.Our fighting men and women put their lives on the line for us. It would be one thing if the intelligence for the Yemen raid was confirmed to be good, and the raid itself was as carefully planned and executed as it could possibly be. Things go wrong with even the best-planned missions   that s a fact. But that s not what happened in Yemen, and our military members shouldn t have to die for an administration that hastily throws an operation together, and then lies about the result. Owens deserves so much more than this, and his blood is on Trump s hands.Featured image by Jim Lo Scalzo via Getty Images"
COMEDY GENIUS: [Video] “Bob Ross” Paints Sick Hillary…H-I-L-A-R-I-O-U-S!,Steven Crowder knocks it out of the park with his brilliant imitation of Bob Ross painting a very sick Hillary 
 JUST IN: White House Responds To Russian Election Hack; Trump Will Be PISSED (VIDEO),"After the CIA came forward that they have intelligence showing Russia s direct involvement in the election to help Donald Trump win, many people are asking for further information, especially before the Electoral College votes on December 19.Now, the White House is using language that they most certainly believe Donald Trump s victory was definitely the reason Russia got involved in the election.White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said: You didn t need a security clearance to figure out who benefited from malicious Russian cyberactivity. The President-elect didn t call it into question, he called on Russia to hack his opponent. He called on Russia to hack Secretary Clinton. So he certainly had a pretty good sense of whose side this cyberactivity was coming down on. The last several week so the election were focused on a discussion of emails that had been hacked and leaked by the Russians. These were emails from the (Democratic National Committee) and John Podesta, not from the (Republican National Committee) and Stephen Bannon. It was the President-elect who over the course of the campaign indicated that he thought that President Putin was a strong leader.

STEVIE WONDER SLAMS Black Lives Matter At MN Peace Conference: “You Cannot Say ‘Black Lives Matter’ and Then Kill Yourselves” [VIDEO],"The music icon spoke at the North Minneapolis Conference on Peace on Saturday.Stevie Wonder spoke out about Black Lives Matter and youth gun violence at the North Minneapolis Conference on Peace on Saturday. It is in your hands to stop all of the killing and the shooting wherever it might be,  Wonder said.  You cannot say,  Black lives matter,  and then kill yourselves. Because you know we ve mattered long before it was said, but the way we show that we matter, the way that we show all the various people of color matter is by loving each other and doing something about it. Not just talking about it, not just waiting to see the media and press come when there s a horrible thing. Watch:Wonder s statement came after he highlighted the fatal shooting of Philando Castile during a traffic stop by former Minnesota police officer Jeronimo Yanez. On Friday, Yanez was acquitted of all charges by a jury.   BillboardThe amazing website heyjackass.com provides up-to-date information on the current gun-crime situation in the  gun-free city of Chicago. Why are there no protests in the city of Chicago from Black Lives Matter?Every 2:30 minutes a person is shot in the city of Chicago. Where is the outrage from the black community over the killing of their own in their communities?"

" Thanks To Trump, Companies Are Pulling Out Of The Republican National Convention","Now that Republicans are only a month away from officially nominating a racist, sexist, bigot, companies responsible for funding the Republican National Convention are pulling out, and for good reason: bigotry isn t good for business.Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase, Motorola, Ford, Walgreens and UPS (all of whom sponsored the 2012 convention) have announced they will be pulling out of this year s convention. Although none of the companies have publicly said why they are pulling out, Trump s continuous slamming of the Ford Corporation could explain why the motor company is calling it quits. Sources close with Wells Fargo say they will continue to sponsor the Democratic National Convention because of a large market outreach in Philadelphia.Coca-Cola has also pulled out of the RNC, citing bad publicity.Reports are surfacing that delegates for the RNC are gearing up to stage a coup against trump, thus brokering the convention and thwarting the billionaire s chances of taking on Hillary Clinton (who would mop the floor with him).Their decision to pull out comes as the RNC is close to reaching their goal of $64 million to fund the convention. With these companies now retracting their monetary support, the RNC will have to find new ways to make up for the lost funds. Maybe they could ask their nominee? He is a  billionaire,  after all.Several months ago, the New York Times reported Apple, Walmart, and Google are considering pulling out as well, as public pressure mounts against the presumptive nominee.Republican fundraising consultant Carla Eudy told the Times:I have talked to several people at companies who have said,  I ve always gone to the convention, I ve always participated at some level, but this year we re not putting it in our budget, we re not going, we re no going to sponsor any of the events going on.Things aren t looking good for the RNC, and yet Reince Priebus insists everything is O.K. when, in fact, nothing is O.K. The public is turning against them, big business is turning against them, and members of their own party are turning against them.Cleveland will be a catastrophe, and it s all thanks to Donald J. Trump. Congratulations, GOP, you built that. Now, reap what you sow.Featured image via Ron Jenkins/Getty Images"
 Democrat Takes Trump To The Woodshed In Fiery Speech Defending NFL (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is getting absolutely hammered for his recent attacks on NFL players who refuse to stand during the National Anthem in a stand against social injustice. Trump has tried his hardest to pass off those attacks as a defense of patriotism, but most Americans know that Trump is simply trying to mask what are obviously remarks fueled by his own racism   and one Democrat is calling him out for it.Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., blasted Trump on the House floor on Monday and attacked the undeserving POTUS for his pathetic attacks on athletes such as Stephen Curry, Lebron James and the NFL players. In his powerful, fiery speech, Jeffries asked the question that most of us would like to know:  How dare Donald lecture us on what s patriotic?!  You can watch this epic speech below:Just defended @StephenCurry30 @KingJames @Kaepernick7 on House floor. How dare donald lecture us on what s patriotic?! pic.twitter.com/wfbtDajTLD  Hakeem Jeffries (@RepJeffries) September 25, 2017And that s not the only time Jeffries has spoken out against Trump about the POTUS  recent attacks on athletes. In an interview with CNN, Jeffries called Trump a  racial arsonist  and stated that Trump was causing controversy just to keep his dwindling conservative fan base happy and engaged. Jeffries said: He uses race to advance his own ends. We couldn t have said it better. It is no coincidence that Trump s fan base are practically just white supremacists   who he has repeatedly failed to denounce because he doesn t want to lost the only support he has left. Trump knows that his fans are losing interest and patience after all of his broken campaign promises, so he creates these  scandals  and spews nonsense to distract everyone and remind his racist fans why they voted for him in the first place. Trump s remarks about the NFL are disgusting and deserve to be condemned again and again.Featured image is a screenshot"
CONSERVATIVES FIGHT BACK Against Proposed “Obamacare Lite”…DEMAND Full Repeal Of Obamacare,"House Republicans leaders on Monday embraced a legislative plan to replace the Affordable Care Act for the first time in the nearly seven years since Democrats enacted the transformative health-insurance law.Now, they have to sell it.That challenge ran into an immediate threat from key conservatives who criticized the new proposal for failing to fulfill the party s iron-clad promise to rip out the signature policy of former President Barack Obama.  It s Obamacare in a different format,  Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, a member of the hardline House Freedom Caucus, said in a phone interview. Jordan cited three provisions that conservatives have complained about for weeks leading up to the formal release of the House GOP plan on Monday evening: its extension of Obamacare Medicaid expansion for another four years; its failure to immediately repeal all of the law s tax increases; and its call to provide refundable tax credits to help people buy insurance, which Jordan labeled  a new entitlement. Earlier on Monday, another member of the Freedom Caucus, Representative Justin Amash of Michigan, condemned the leadership bill in a two-word tweet:  Obamacare 2.0.  The full Freedom Caucus comprises about three dozen members of the 237 in the House Republican majority. If they voted as a bloc, they could sink the bill on their own. A spokeswoman for its chairman, Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, said members were still reviewing the legislation on Monday evening, and Jordan said the group planned to meet on Tuesday to discuss it.The reaction from conservative advocacy groups was no more favorable to the Republican leadership. FreedomWorks labeled the plan s requirement that people pay a 30 percent premium to insurers if they stop their coverage for more than two months  the Republican individual mandate. And on Tuesday morning, two more staunchly conservative activist organizations, Heritage Action and the Club for Growth, came out against the proposal.  Many Americans seeking health insurance on the individual market will notice no significant difference between the Affordable Care Act (i.e., Obamacare) and the American Health Care Act,  the group s president, Michael Needham said.  That is bad politics and, more importantly, bad policy. Rather than accept the flawed premises of Obamacare, congressional Republicans should fully repeal the failed law and begin a genuine effort to deliver on longstanding campaign promises that create a free market health-care system that empowers patients and doctors.  The Club for Growth pejoratively dubbed the new bill  RyanCare  and added a new threat, vowing to downgrade any Republican who votes for the bill in the group s closely-watched annual congressional scorecard.- The AtlanticThe introduction of the GOP s new healthcare bill has raised some definite ire among Republicans and Libertarians alike. Kentucky Senator Rand Paul is one such politician who has now seen the bill and expressed his extreme dislike of it, calling the GOP plan  Obamacare Lite. According to The Hill, Paul is not letting Obamacare Lite happen without a fight, and he has allies. The libertarian leaning senator is teaming up with Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) to release their own bill to repeal Obamacare on Wednesday, and it s highly similar to the one that Republicans voted for unanimously in 2015. We voted on this last year, and every Republican voted for it,  Paul said at a press conference alongside his House conservative colleagues.  That s what we should do again. You have to get rid of ObamaCare completely,  Jordan added. Paul stated in an interview earlier today that this GOP bill  will not pass,  and that  conservatives aren t gonna to take it.  However Paul and Jordan face an uphill struggle as GOP leadership, including that of President Donald Trump, seem to believe the bill to be a solid plan. We re going to do something that s great. And I am proud to support the replacement plan released by the House of Representatives,  Trump said of the bill.  It follows the guidelines I laid out in my congressional address. This will be a plan where you can choose your doctor and this will be a plan where you can choose your plan. And you know what the plan is. This is the plan.    The Blaze"
Boycott! Singer John Legend Calls Trump “An Embarrassment”…Asks For ‘Out of Shape’ White People to Play Trump Supporters in Music Video,"Famous singer John Legend posted a very offensive casting call for actors who look like Trump supporters. He s showing how clueless he is about Trump supporters They come in all shapes, colors and sizes. He s also just offended millions of Americans by being a big racist. Boycott this jerk!According to a listing on Casting Networks in LA, the musician s newest video requires eight white men and women, 30-65 years old, who are  preferably out of shape.  The actors will be playing protesters on a set of a political rally with a Black Lives Matter group playing the opposition.Legend, 38, is not afraid to speak his mind when it comes to politics, so it is no surprise he is incorporating his opinions into his music videos.A BITTER HOLLYWOOD ELITIST: In an interview with Guardian on Sunday, the Beauty And The Beast singer said:  I think Trump is an embarrassment to the country. The singer is married to supermodel Chrissy Teigen. She s battling alcoholism in a very public way. You d think he d circle the wagons  and take care of his wife and one-year old daughter. It s a shame that the bitterness and hate for Trump and his supporters is living rent-free in John Legend s head.He gets really nasty in the Guardian interview:  When he is criticising something, he is usually projecting. So, he calls people liars because he is a liar.  He talks about people being violent because he encourages violence,  he continued. One word for Legend ANTIFARead more: Daily Mail"
FAMILY OF S.C.

 Even His Allies Admit Hillary Won The Debate And Trump Is FREAKING OUT About It,"Unless you count online polls that Trump fans voted in multiple times to make it appear as if he won Monday s presidential debate, Donald Trump actually lost. Most pundits feel he lost, as did the focus groups used by several of the networks, as did scientific polls that were taken of people who watched the event. He lost, handily.Trump lost so badly that even his allies who want to see him elected President have been complaining to the media about his limp performance. And that has made Trump very very angry.In a conference call with surrogates Wednesday afternoon, Trump aides made clear the Republican nominee is upset that his allies publicly acknowledged they pushed him to change his preparation and tactics before his next bout with Hillary Clinton. And he wants them to stop it immediately.The message was  not subtle,  a source familiar with the call said.Trump wants his supporters to make an energetic defense of his performance and refuse to concede that he didn t nail it.In the world of Trump and his ego, admitting that you lost a battle is the worst thing, possibly even worse than actually losing the battle itself. For someone like Trump, who fancies himself an  alpha  male, an admission of humility or defeat is the worst possible scenario. In his eyes, anyone conceding that he underperformed is unacceptable, and even worse if you re in the Trump orbit.That is why Trump almost completely limits himself to media appearances on Fox News, where he won t ever seriously be challenged on even the most bizarre and untrue claims he makes in the campaign. Trump is inside a bubble, only speaking to those who agree with him and who want to suck up to him. He is being told time and time again by his hangers-on that he is doing everything just right. And he won t tolerate anybody who allows reality to intrude.Featured image via Flickr"
THE REAL REASON JOE BIDEN HASN’T ANNOUNCED HE’S RUNNING YET: Reliable Investigative Reporter Shares The Disturbing Inside Scoop,"Obama couldn t just endorse Joe Biden because like a loyal dog, he s defended every one of his unconstitutional acts against America. No Obama doesn t do anything without injecting Chicago style politics into the equation. In this case, he will only endorse one of the dumbest men in Washington DC for our next President if he agrees to his radical terms.How very  Putin-esque The talk in Democratic Party circles is that Barack Obama has told Joe Biden that he is prepared to endorse him for president if, in return, Biden promises to let Obama have a final say in the choice of his vice presidential running mate.According to these Democratic sources, Biden is mulling over the president s conditional offer of support.In addition, there is speculation among top Democratic sources that Obama has another quid pro quo for his endorsement: he wants Biden to choose an African American as his vice presidential running mate.In this scenario, which Obama has not yet fully explained to Biden, Biden would promise to serve only one term in the White House, after which he would back his vice president to succeed him.As Biden s vice president, Obama is said to favor former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick, a close Obama ally who is the first and only African American to have served as governor of the Bay State.Obama has already given Biden carte blanche to use Air Force Two, the official vice presidential plane, to crisscross the country and launch an unofficial campaign.So far, Biden has visited several key primary and general election states and hammered GOP frontrunner Donald Trump, charging that Trump is offering a  sick message  on immigration.Biden has also courted the Jewish vote, hinting that he will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.With Obama s blessing, Biden appeared on  The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,  where he discussed his son Beau s death from brain cancer and came across as an authentic alternative to the stiff and overly scripted Hillary Clinton.

 WATCH: New Music Video Calls On Supporters To Keep Rallying For Bernie Sanders,"Bernie Sanders, the upstart and relatively unknown senator from Vermont, has captured the hearts and minds of people from all generations and walks of life, especially young Americans who are the future of tomorrow. He s ignited a passion for the political process not seen in generations. One of his gifts has been his ability to explain the major issues America is facing today and to offer actual solutions to problems. His straight talk has been refreshing in a political process that borders on the repulsive this election year, especially when it comes to GOP candidates, who often attack each other rather than the issues, making a mockery of the Republican Party and setting a bad example for America. Bernie s straight talk is summed up in a new song called Bernie, Bernie, Bernie, a rallying call for Bernie s supporters to continue the march toward the Democratic nomination.The lyrics in the song include the following: He s come to save democracy from the greed of the plutocracy and slay the phony narrative and make healthcare an imperative. About income inequality and media frivolity, they ll tell you you re just out of luck, while Bernie fights for 15 bucks. Perhaps the most attractive aspect about Bernie Sanders  candidacy is his ability to take stances on issues. Unlike most politicians, the senator actually has views on issues and offers solutions rather than what most politicians do, which is to avoid taking a stance for fear of losing votes.Whether Bernie Sanders is able to win the Democratic nomination or not, he s already changed America. For example, he taught other politicians that if you criticize Israel for its abhorrent treatment of the Palestinians,  you ll survive as a politician, despite the seditious influence that Israel lobby groups have over the American political system. Politicians will have to listen to voters who call for universal healthcare and an America first attitude and Bernie Sanders has been able to normalize this talk.The Bernie Sanders revolution is here.Watch the video here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5a2NAfsC4I]Featured image via video screenshot."
U.S. NEWS and WORLD REPORT Publishes List Of TOP 10 MOST POPULAR NATIONS Where Refugees Want To Live,"More than 21,000 people from all regions of the world participated in the Best Countries survey, in which they assessed how closely they associated 80 countries with specific characteristics. Four of these    economically stable,   good job market,   income equality  and  is a place I would live    were included in the Best Countries to Be an Immigrant ranking.Countries also were scored in relation to others on the share of migrants in their population; the amount of remittances the migrants they host sent home; and graded on a United Nations assessment of integration measures provided for immigrants, such as language training and transfers of job certifications, and the rationale behind current integration policies. [LOL! NOT assimilation! ed]Note how important remittances are! Those are dollars sent out of the host economy and I will bet a buck that any economic study that seeks to justify migration benefits to a country, NEVER factors in how much of the migrants  earnings (or their welfare payments!) are sent OUT of the country (and thus lost to the host country s economy!).

BREAKING: OBAMA APPOINTED JUDGE Demands RNC Reveal Trump’s Plans To Prevent Voter Fraud,"Just look away. The Democrats don t have any plans to steal your vote. If you don t believe us, ask this Obama appointed judge who s making it his business to make sure Republicans don t get involved protecting the sanctity of the vote for every American A federal judge is ordering the Republican National Committee to detail any agreements it has with Donald Trump s campaign to engage in  ballot security  efforts in connection with next week s election   something the national GOP has been banned from doing for decades without court approval.The order also instructs the RNC to explain by 5 p.m. Tuesday what Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway and GOP vice presidential nominee Mike Pence were talking about in recent comments when they said that Trump s campaign was working closely with the RNC to make sure there is no fraud at the polls. Newark, N.J.-based U.S. District Court John Vazquez issued the order Monday after the Democratic National Committee went to court last week to allege that the RNC was violating consent decrees from the 1980s settling a case alleging that GOP pollwatchers sought to intimidate minority voters in a practice then known as  caging. The agreements allow the RNC to organize poll watchers, but prohibit any effort to intimidate voters as they enter a polling place or to challenge individual voters, except as part of a program approved in advance by the court.Here s a little reminder (video below) of how the New Black Panthers intimidated voters outside of a polling place in Philadelphia. But by all means, the RNC and the Trump campaign should just look away The RNC insists it has worked to ensure compliance with the agreement and submitted to the court a series of memos sent to its personnel, national committee members and others from August through this month reminding them about the consent decree and the need to remain at arms length from all ballot security efforts. The memos tell RNC workers, officials and volunteers not to engage in poll watching efforts at all, not to take video or audio recordings at polling places and not to mention ballot fraud concerns on social media sites like Facebook and Twitter.However, in August, Pence appeared to indicate there was a joint effort by the Trump campaign and the RNC to combat voter fraud.  The Trump Campaign and the Republican National Committee are working very, very closely with state governments and secretaries of state all over the country to ensure ballot integrity,  Pence said at a town hall meeting in Denver in August.In addition, Conway reportedly told the Washington Post last month that the Trump campaign is  actively working with the national committee, the official party, and campaign lawyers to monitor precincts around the country.

" Here’s The List Of Items Trump Banned From Inauguration, Including Guns","Remember when the National Rifle Association warned Americans that President Obama was going to confiscate guns from responsible firearm owners and then he didn t? Remember when Obama spoke at events and those opposed to his presidency showed up armed and the president gave zero f*cks? Then remember when Donald Trump said, I Could Stand In the Middle Of Fifth Avenue And Shoot Somebody And I Wouldn t Lose Any Voters.  He probably wasn t wrong there. His supporters are unhinged but devoted. As a candidate, Trump garnered strong support from gun owners and the NRA. As a candidate, he promised to keep the Second Amendment intact. As president-elect, he just banned guns from his inauguration.Gizmodo reports:The transition team has drawn up a list of banned items. For instance, you can t bring drones, selfie sticks, or guns. Which all sounds a bit like 1984, if you ask me. I thought Trump was supposed to be the candidate of freedom. More like the candidate of taking our guns away, amirite?At least it looks like vapes aren t included on the verboten list. Which should make Grover Norquist pretty happy. And it makes sense to ban bicycles, since only granola-gulping, latte-sipping pinkos ride bikes. But why does Trump gotta take away all our fun toys like selfie sticks and firearms?The gun grabbing Marxist-Commie s list of banned items are as follows:Aerosols Ammunition Animals other than service/guide animals Backpacks and bags exceeding size restrictions (18  by 13  by 7 ) Bicycles Balloons Coolers Drones and other unmanned aircraft systems Explosives Firearms Glass, thermal, or metal containers Laser pointers Mace / Pepper spray Packages Selfie Sticks Signs exceeding the size restrictions (20  x 3  x 1/4 ) Structures Supports for signs and placards Toy guns Weapons of any kindAt the bottom of the list it reads,  Any other items determined to be potential safety hazards.

 WATCH: Hell Freezes As Fox News Host Calls Republican Party A ‘Disgrace’ For Being Incapable Of Governing,"Things just went from bad to worse for the Republican Party.Being in charge just isn t what Republicans imagined it would be like.After all, they have majority control of the House and Senate and have the perfect puppet in the White House to rubber stamp their destructive agenda.But millions of angry Americans across the country, including Democrats, Republicans, and independents, have made Republicans in Congress incredibly nervous about the GOP healthcare bill. Nervous enough to actually oppose it.The Trumpcare bill would strip healthcare away from 20 million Americans and cause premiums to skyrocket, both of which Donald Trump promised would not happen. In short, he lied, and many Republicans don t want to commit political suicide with him.The Republican failure to pass their terrible bill is good for the American people, but it s politically harmful to the GOP because their failure to pass their own bill despite having majority control makes them look incompetent of governing.Keep in mind that Republicans have insisted for years that they are more capable of governing the United States than Democrats. But when Americans actually put them in charge of the entire government it turns out Republicans were all talk and no walk.Rather than govern, Republicans have let Trump systematically destroy this country and now they have failed miserably in their first effort to pass a major policy on their agenda.And even Fox News is disgusted by how Republicans have performed.During his show on Fox Business on Friday, stalwart Republican cheerleader Stuart Varney literally called the entire Republican Party a  disgrace  and conceded that  they can t govern,  much to the surprise of Juan Williams. I personally believe at this moment in time, the Republican Party is a disgrace,  Varney declared.  I m serious. I am serious. We elected the Republicans to run the House, the Senate and the White House and the very, very first thing that comes up on the legislative agenda they vote no, they re split. They can t do it. They can t govern. I am really fit to be tied. Varney invited Williams to take shots at him and the GOP but he declined to do so, opting instead to point out that the Republicans who oppose this bill are doing so because it s a bad bill.Here s the video via YouTube:Indeed, the bill is not better than the Affordable Care Act. In fact, it kills all of the good things the Affordable Care Act provides and takes America back to a time when the uninsured rate was shockingly high and people had to choose between paying for healthcare or paying their bills to avoid homelessness and starvation.But Republicans only have themselves to blame what the position they are in right now. Rather than supporting a law that includes many Republican ideas such as an individual mandate, they chose to viciously oppose the law instead and demonize it for political gain. Furthermore, they had seven years to come up with a better healthcare plan and couldn t even do that. More Americans now understand that the Affordable Care Act was not the evil Republicans portrayed it to be and they now want to save it. Americans are learning about all the good things Republicans would be destroying by repealing it.And now even Fox News is having a hard time defending Republicans on this issue. And losing the support of their propaganda machine should signal to Republicans that they have royally f*cked up.Featured image via screenshot"
POLICE IN GERMANY BEGIN RAIDS On Homes Of Facebook Users Who Post “Hate Speech” Against Refugees,"If Facebook has aligned themselves with Germany to restrict the free speech of its users, what makes us so sure they won t do the same thing in the US with Obama or (God forbid) a Hillary presidency? And wouldn t Germany be better off focusing their policing efforts on the over 1 million freeloaders and terrorists they ve just admitted into Germanista?Police in Germany have started carrying out raids in peoples homes in an attempt to prosecute people for inciting  hate speech  on Facebook.A press release from Germany s federal police agency confirmed that around 60 homes were searched this week as a result of people posting messages deemed as extreme by the German authorities. The action carried out today shows that the authorities are acting firmly against hate on the internet, which has grown considerably in the wake of the refugee situation,  said Holger M nch, head of the BKA, said in the statement. Attacks on refugees are often the result of radicalization, which begins on social networks. These words should not poison the social climate,  he continued.The move comes after it was revealed in January that Mark Zuckerberg had teamed up with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in order to censor people s frustrations with her migrant policy, when she decided to open up Germany s borders to millions of migrants last year.Facebook consequently introduced a policy where they agreed to remove anything deemed as  hate speech  within 24 hours.

 Tea Party Superstar Gets WRECKED After Obama ‘N****r’ Tweet,"Tea Party darling and deadbeat dad extraordinaire Joe Walsh managed to be douchier than is typical on Sunday when he attacked Michael Che for saying something mean about Donald Trump.It may seem nonsensical that the  fuck your feelings  crowd gets sad every time someone says something to  trigger  them, but Walsh apparently needs a safe space after SNL s Michael Che called Donald Trump a  cracker  (among other things).Like all conservatives at some point in their lives, Walsh became  economically disenfranchised  (the media s term for racism among Trump voters) enough upon hearing Trump described as a  cracker  (the name of an all-white minor league baseball team in Atlanta, Georgia in the early parts of last century) to bust out the  n*gger  word.Naturally, The People were not amused:You thinking there is any equivalence between those two words demonstrates how thoroughly out of touch you are.  bob clendenin (@bobclendenin) October 1, 2017Why do white conservatives want to say that word so bad?

The same goes for Mr. Walsh (possibly without the bit about incest fantasies), who habitually fails to pay child support and probably smells like bourbon and the booths at a sketchy adult video store the majority of the time.If Mr. Walsh wishes to fire back, I regularly receive love letters calling me a  Jew.

Unreal!ANTHONY BRIAN LOGAN (VIDEO BELOW) GIVES HIS TAKE ON THIS  DIVERSITY TRAINING :Ashleigh Shackelford, a black female  activist , gave a short lecture in front of a crowd of mostly working-aged white people that covered one issue: all white people are racist. It was difficult to tell where this talk was being held. At a school, a place of business, or a lecture hall where people paid to come see her. Either way, it was a strange sight to see a room full of people be spoken about in such a negative way without reacting in a defensive way  or reacting at all. It was also strange to see the audience members dressed in a business casual way sitting before Ashleigh who was dressed like she just got out of bed in clothing that fit way too small for her very large frame.Talks like the one given in the video are unfortunately becoming very common. Some of these so-called activists get paid to speak at corporate meetings as some sort of diversity checklist. Even white men like Tim Wise get paid lots of money to berate white people at places like Google. Much of this culture comes from the belly of the beast of liberalism which is the San Francisco bay area. Much of the tech world is run here but it is also a hotbed for radical liberalism. So when the two of those worlds mix, what you end up with is individuals like Ashleigh Shackelford allowed to run amok. Her issue may be one of envy and ensuing resentment of white people, but the force which allows her to vent her frustrations in an open way can be found in socially and politically liberal hotbeds across the country   especially California.Here is info from Shackelford s website: Ashleigh Shackelford is a queer, non binary Black fat femme writer, cultural producer, and artist. She is a contributing writer at Wear Your Voice Magazine and For Harriet. In her commitment to creating and imagining new worlds, Ashleigh created an organization for body positivity   Free Figure Revolution, and a coalition for afrofuturism entitled Black Futurism. When she s not writing Facebook statuses as novels, Ashleigh is working on producing cultural storytelling of and by Black fat femmes."

 The New GOP Healthcare Bill Targets Women And Plans To Defund Planned Parenthood,"The super top-secret GOP healthcare bill has been released. Hidden within all the kerfuffle is a woman s worst nightmare: Planned Parenthood losing its funding.Reported by The Hill, the Senate healthcare bill will defund Planned Parenthood for one year. The GOP bill follows the same language in the House-passed health care bill that blocks Medicaid reimbursements to Planned Parenthood.If this bill goes through, the beacon of women s health care and abortion services will be gone unless Planned Parenthood can find another viable option for funding.Of course, it s not just women that Planned Parenthood helps. They provide health care for women, men, young people, while also acting as the U.S. s largest provider of sex education. All are very crucial services.It s vital that Planned Parenthood retains its funding and we need people and our government to understand that. Thankfully, two Republican senators, Lisa Murkowski (Ala.) and Susan Collins (Maine), have already suggested they may not support the bill if it defunds Planned Parenthood, The Hill reports.Collins said Wednesday if the bill included defunding language, she and Murkowski would introduce an amendment to strip it out.Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards released a statement saying: If this is the Senate s idea of a bill with heart, then the women of America should have fear struck in theirs. Slashing Medicaid and blocking millions of women from getting preventive care at Planned Parenthood is beyond heartless. One in five women in this country rely on Planned Parenthood for care. They will not stay silent as politicians vote to take away their care and their rights. Source: The HillIs this really what many Republicans say they want? To strip women of their beacon of health and wellness? People need to stay out of other people s business and live and let live.Featured image by Ronen Tivony/NurPhoto via Getty Images"
IRONY! COLLEGE “ANTI-CAPITALIST” GROUP DISBANDS Because Members Were too Rich and White,"You just can t make this stuff up! does anyone else see the HUGE irony in this?A Marxist student group at Swarthmore College disbanded itself earlier this year after realizing that its members were too rich and too white to be real commies.According to screenshots confidentially provided to Campus Reform by an individual with access to the group s private Facebook page, the demise of the Swarthmore Anti-Capitalist Collective (SACC) came in the wake of a farewell letter from a member who had decided the group could never be an effective proponent of  unproblematized anticapitalist politics  due to its  history of abuse, racism, and even classism. From my understanding SACC disbanded because they realized the makeup and tactics of their group was at odds with their espoused principles,  Swarthmore Conservative Society President Gilbert Guerra told Campus Reform.  Their main support base was middle-upper class white kids who enjoy jogging. The farewell letter corroborates Guerra s understanding, asserting that  SACC s fundamental failure  was that  at its formation, it was made up of entirely white, with the exception of one person of color*, students,  and to make matters worse,  not one of [the founding members] are from low-income and/or working class backgrounds. Arguing that  low-income people of color should never be an afterthought in a group whose politics supposedly focus on their liberation,  the author then went on to accuse SACC of having a  history of abuse, racism, and even classism that was never adequately addressed or recognized despite constantly being brought up as an issue.

In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally,  Trump wrote last month.In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016The claim has been repeatedly debunked ever since and people in both parties have criticized Trump for it.Politifact gave the claim a  Pants on Fire  rating because Trump got the information from right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones who got it from some guy who refused to provide evidence to support his claim.When Stephanopoulos interviewed Pence, he demanded to know if he thinks it s responsible for Trump to make false claims. That claim is groundless,  Stephanopoulos said.  There s no evidence to back it up. Is it responsible for a president-elect to make false statements like that? Pence pathetically defended Trump by bringing up a 2012 Pew Center study that even the study s own author says does not prove widespread voter fraud, especially the kind of voter fraud Trump is claiming.Once again, Stephanopoulos informed Pence that Trump s statement  is false. Pence continued to pretend that Trump has evidence to back up his claim and suggested that he has the right to make claim claims. I think the president-elect just wants to call to attention the fact that there has been evidence over many years,  Pence said.  It s certainly his right. It s his right to make false statements?  a bewildered Stephanopoulos asked.Pence responded by dodging the question and called Trump  refreshing  while praising his ability to brainwash people into hanging on his every word. I think one of the things that s refreshing about our president-elect. I think he made such an incredible connection with people all across this country because he tells you what s on his mind. Stephanopoulos refused to let Pence get away with not answering his question.  But why is it refreshing to make false statements?  he asked.And then the interview got testy as Pence claimed that nobody knows if Trump s statement is false or not, leading Stephanopoulos to hit Pence hard to conclude the interview.PENCE:  I don t know that is a false statement and neither do you. There is historic evidence from the Pew Research Center that voter fraud has taken place. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Can you provide any evidence to back up that statement? PENCE:  He s entitled to express his opinion on that. I think the American people find it very refreshing that they have a president who will tell them what s on his mind. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Whether it s true or not.

BOYCOTT BACKFIRES! Ivanka Trump Clothing Line Reports Record Sales,"Ivanka Trump s eponymous women s fashion line is reporting record sales figures despite calls for a boycott and controversies surrounding President Trump. Since the beginning of February, they were some of the best performing weeks in the history of the brand,  Abigail Klem, the president of the Ivanka Trump fashion brand, tells Refinery29 in an interview published Tuesday.  For several different retailers Ivanka Trump was a top performer online, and in some of the categories it was the [brand s] best performance ever. The news of a sales surge comes after Nordstrom announced in early February that it would no longer carry the 35-year-old s clothing and accessories, citing poor product sales. The move caused President Trump to tweet shortly after the announcement that his daughter was being  treated so unfairly  by the luxury department store giant.Also last month, Neiman Marcus stopped carrying the first daughter s jewelry line on its website, and employees of T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores were instructed to throw away any signage advertising her wares. The Office of Government Ethics recommended disciplinary action against White House adviser Kellyanne Conway after she urged viewers to  go buy Ivanka s stuff  during a February interview on  Fox & Friends. A campaign called Grab Your Wallet, which is critical of the Trump administration, asked shoppers to boycott retailers with any Ivanka or Donald Trump-branded products.According to the e-commerce aggregator Lyst, from January to February, Ivanka Trump sales increased 346 percent, Refinery29 writes.Read more: The Hill"

 Trump Tells His Supporters Poor People Are Too Stupid To Be In His Cabinet (VIDEO),"Alleged President Donald Trump has been on the job for only 153 days and he held another ego-rally on Wednesday. The crowd of adoring Trump fans cheered him on as he spoke down to them in a condescending manner. The former reality show star who ran on a  Drain the Swamp  platform offered an explanation in Iowa for why he has one of the wealthiest cabinets in U.S. history. The amateur president suggested that he hired billionaire private-equity investor Wilbur Ross to be his Commerce secretary because he isn t poor. Trump said,  I just don t want a poor person  in a top economics role. I love all people   rich or poor   but in those particular positions, I just don t want a poor person,  he said at a rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  Does that make sense? If you insist, I ll do it   but I like it better this way. That led to cheers from his supporters.CNN reports:Trump named billionaire Wilbur Ross, who has made a fortune cobbling together dying companies, as his commerce secretary, and Todd Ricketts, part of the billionaire family that owns the Chicago Cubs, as deputy commerce secretary.The Cabinet also includes billionaire Betsy DeVos as his pick for education secretary and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is a former Goldman Sachs executive. Somebody said,  Why d you appoint a rich person to be in charge of the economy,'  said Trump.  I said,  Because that s the kind of thinking we want.' They re representing the country. They don t want the money. They re representing the country. They had to give up a lot to take these jobs. They gave up a lot,  he said.Trump noted that Ross and his chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs president, were at the Iowa rally. That s right, Trump brought the swamp to Iowa and his supporters cheered him on. But, while on the campaign trail, Trump frequently bashed Goldman Sachs for having too much influence in politics and for paying Democratic rival Hillary Clinton for private speeches.Watch:Let s review history for a moment.It was in 1789 that George Washington, the first elected President of the U.S., tapped his former aide to be the first Secretary of the Treasury. Alexander Hamilton grew up poor and he was an immigrant from the Caribbean island of Nevis   his image is featured on our $10 bill.But, in Trump s world, Hamilton, who was an author of the Federalist Papers, would be too poor to be chosen for his administration. Trump suggested to his crowd of supporters that only rich people are smart. Those same supporters still see nothing wrong with the alleged billionaire not revealing his tax returns.According to Trump, billionaires are smart and the rest of us are dumb mother f*ckers.  Trump also raged about the media s coverage of his  presidency  during his rally.Well, we can prove that wealthy people aren t always smart or have compassion. Citation: Donald J.

In the border town of Tijuana, 300 Haitians arrived on Sunday alone.There have been almost 10,000 foreigners in the border town of Tijuana in the past five months, and activists project this could reach 16,000. There has been violence due to this influx in foreigners and police have had to intervene. Maria del Rosario Lozada Romero, director of migrant care in the area, told Excelsior,  They themselves cause this disorder, they don t cooperate, and they hit women. More than 4,300 Haitians have entered the San Diego border crossing of San Ysidro between October 2015 and August 31, 2016, the San Diego Union Tribune reports. The Haitians along with the African migrants typically originate from Brazil where they were working or just took a boat to with the purpose of reaching the US. South American countries have liberal immigration policies allowing the migrants to reach Central America with ease.These immigrants either seek asylum in the United States or cross over illegally. Immigrants from Haiti along with Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, and South Sudan can live free of risk of deportation in the United States due to Obama administration policies.Read more: Daily Caller"

BIGGER THAN SNOWDEN: Wikileaks ‘Vault 7’ Classified CIA leak  – What Does It Mean?," He who controls the spice controls the universe.    Frank Herbert,  from the Dune seriesShawn Helton   21st Century WireOver the past week, much of the CIA s cyber hacking capabilities were allegedly laid bare by the Wikileaks  Vault 7  publication. According to the transparency seeking website, they ve published less than 1% of the intelligence regarding their Vault 7 series under the moniker Year Zero. All in all, the Wikileaks Vault 7 release is said to be the largest publication of classified intelligence in history. While there are still many unknowns associated with this latest CIA centered leak, there are a quite a few things to consider.Let s explore some of what we know to date and how it relates to other suspicious tech related stories over the past few years   YEAR ZERO   ZERO DAYS     Wikileaks discloses the CIA s cyber hacking capabilities   still no official comment from the intelligence agency. (Photo Illustration 21WIRE s Shawn Helton)Wikileaks  Vault 7 In 21WIRE s first report regarding the new revelations concerning Wikileaks Vault 7, we discussed how some of the content exposed in part one of Year Zero revealed what many in new media and other investigative fields have thought technologically possible for years.Here s a portion from the 21WIRE news alert mentioned above that describes the latest controversial publication by Wikileaks: WikiLeaks has released its largest ever publication of confidential documents on the Central Intelligence Agency. Entitled  Vault 7  and containing a password that echoed the alleged JFK quote  splinter the CIA into a thousand pieces and scatter it into the winds,  this leak comprises 8,761 documents and files from an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA s Center for Cyber Intelligence in Langley, Virginia. Year Zero , which is part one of the leak and conveniently named after a  zero day  exploit used by intelligence agencies, was gathered throughout 2016 and is said to be the  largest intelligence publication in history .Whilst a lot of the information and methodology outlined in  Year Zero  is of no surprise to security analysts and researchers since the Edward Snowden (image, left) revelations, once again the public has explicit confirmation of how one of the most powerful intelligence agencies in the world, aided by their international counterparts like GCHQ, have been infiltrating and scooping vast quantities of private information from Apple and Android devices right up to Samsung  Smart TV  technology where false  stand-by  modes and live microphones can be executed to record information and send it back to the appropriate servers. The  Year Zero  leaks a simple but cleaver play on the term zero day   something which is defined on Wikipedia as an undisclosed computer-software vulnerability that hackers can exploit to adversely affect computer programs, data, additional computers or a network. A zero day, zero hour exploit is said to leave a software author without the necessary time to correct coding or  workaround  actions of a particular hack or intrusive malware damage. (Image Source: daily express)According to Wikileaks and its editor-in-chief  Julian Assange, their most recent  treasure trove  of confidential files were obtained by a current or former CIA contractor, a story similar in scope and impact to the collection of documents dropped by former CIA/NSA contractor Edward Snowden but are said to be much larger.This time, the public has been given a glance inside the prism of the CIA s cyber hacking potential and data mining efforts similar to the NSA.In May of 2013, Snowden revealed information displaying that American citizens as well as other foreign nations throughout the world were subject to unprecedented levels of spying at the behest of the NSA. Massive data mining via XKeyScore and other similar applications proved to be very controversial particularly in America   as it seemed to be in direct contradiction to the US Constitution s 4th Amendment.Over the past decade other aspects of NSA spying activities were revealed under the George W Bush administration in 2005 and further brought to light by Mark Klein, a former AT&T technician who exposed how the multinational telecommunications company was working with the intelligence community to collect the public s data.In 2011, Gadgets and Gizmos reported the following: The recent Web 2.0 2011 conference in San Francisco saw the issue made public and now the worry is that private information could be obtained by third parties using this secretly stored data.Once the data is accessed it can even be downloaded onto an interactive map which shows where the owner of the device has been lately. So far the best way to avoid this causing a problem is to go into the settings menu and turn of the location services all together. The newly leaked Vault 7 documents identify specific cyber weapons, hacking systems, viruses and malware created by the CIA that can be used on just about anyone or any entity. This most assuredly will cause other countries to become more critical of the agency s cyber capabilities. By the looks of it, this is something that appears to be happening in Germany, as the Wikileaks docu-dump exposed an apparent CIA spy-hub in Frankfurt.Zero Hedge reports: The consulate was the focus of a German investigation into US intelligence capabilities following the 2013 revelation that NSA agents had tapped Chancellor Angela Merkel s phone.German daily  S ddeutsche Zeitung  reported the building was known to be home to a vast network of intelligence personnel including CIA agents, NSA spies, military secret service personnel, Department of Homeland Security employees and Secret Service employees. It reported the Americans had also established a dense network of outposts and shell companies in Frankfurt. Germany s reaction could prove to be more theatrical than that of true concern   only time will tell.If Vault 7 is to be accepted wholesale, it also reveals that since the 9/11 attacks the CIA has gained political and budgetary preeminence over the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). The CIA found itself building not just its now infamous drone fleet, but a very different type of covert, globe-spanning force   its own substantial fleet of hackers.  Part and parcel to this, Wikileaks contends that CIA hackers have developed cyber weaponry to spy on people through cell phones, computers and smart TVs.According to  Year Zero  part one of the Wikileaks Vault 7 release: The increasing sophistication of surveillance techniques has drawn comparisons with George Orwell s 1984, but  Weeping Angel , developed by the CIA s Embedded Devices Branch (EDB), which infests smart TVs, transforming them into covert microphones, is surely its most emblematic realization.The attack against Samsung smart TVs was developed in cooperation with the United Kingdom s MI5/BTSS. After infestation, Weeping Angel places the target TV in a  Fake-Off  mode, so that the owner falsely believes the TV is off when it is on. In  Fake-Off  mode the TV operates as a bug, recording conversations in the room and sending them over the Internet to a covert CIA server. Interestingly, Wikileaks published a batch of classified CIA spy/hacking documents that not only include the privacy invading  Weeping Angel  developed by the clandestine agency to listen on microphones covertly but also ways the CIA has sought to remotely infect and control Microsoft Windows,  with viruses like  Hammer Drill  as well as automated infestation and control of CIA malware, such as  Assassin  and  Medusa. According to security analysts, the CIA has designed the covert methods listed above for hostile foreign actors. However, since the intelligence service has had a propensity of going rogue, these technological leaps made by the secretive agency should be a major concern to the general public.Over the past few decades there have been other spoken critics of intelligence services such as well-known journalist James Bamford and former high-ranking NSA official William Binney, both who have come forward to share the inner workings of the security world. The screenshot above from Wikileaks Vault 7 discusses CIA s techniques that can be used to frame other entities for a malware attack.Framing the Big Bear?One of the more curious details contained in Vault 7 were the revelations concerning the CIA s ability to mask any hacking  fingerprints that could potentially implicate the agency. Additionally, the secretive agency could also leave behind potential evidence that a cyber attack was carried out by a foreign body or nation. Here s another passage from the Wikileaks publication on the matter: Tradecraft DO s and DON Ts  contains CIA rules on how its malware should be written to avoid fingerprints implicating the  CIA, US government, or its witting partner companies  in  forensic review . QUESTION: Is it possible that the CIA could use its highly specialized malware to frame a foreign country for violating US national security?Zero Hedge reported the following Wikileaks information concerning the CIA s ability to bypass device encryption before it can be applied as well as mask itself from forensic review via its own entity, the Center For Cyber Inteliigence (CCI):Among the more notable disclosures which, if confirmed,  would rock the technology world , the CIA had managed to bypass encryption on popular phone and messaging services such as Signal, WhatsApp and Telegram. According to the statement from WikiLeaks, government hackers can penetrate Android phones and collect  audio and message traffic before encryption is applied. Another profound revelation is that the CIA can engage in  false flag  cyberattacks which portray Russia as the assailant. Discussing the CIA s Remote Devices Branch s UMBRAGE group, Wikileaks  source notes that it  collects and maintains a substantial library of attack techniques  stolen  from malware produced in other states including the Russian Federation. Here s an image originally published by Wikileaks Vault 7 that displays the CIA s Center For Cyber Intelligence apparatus With claims of alleged Russian hacking at the forefront of Western intelligence, let s take another look at how that meme started Prior to the 2016 US presidential race taking place the mainstream media along with the White House, set the stage for a massive PR push implicating Russia as a disrupting force for democracy   allegedly through Kremlin-sponsored hacking of US democratic institutions and through  sophisticated Russian propaganda. In August, the western media s claims against Russia began to hit overdrive, when the  New York Times s Moscow bureau was the target of an attempted cyber attack this month. But so far, there is no evidence that the hackers, believed to be Russian, were successful. Flash forward to September here and here, as well as early October in the lead up to President Obama s Russian Hack decree, the Clinton-friendly outlet, the NY Times, had all but solidified the Russian cyber-hack claims   but once again, without any definitive evidence or proof.Throw in another American  October surprise  in the form distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, renewed calls for the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) internet, led to so-called cyber experts blaming the largest  hack on America  because of the inability to pass SOPA   in effect, reigniting the previously stalled SOPA in Washington DC, along with all of its draconian copyright law positions   all perfectly timed as mainstream reports regarding  fake news suddenly became all the rage across all forms of media.Will Vault 7 prove to shed light on other CIA related activities?The screenshot above from Wikileaks Vault 7 discusses the CIA S HIVE multi-platform software control system.DDoS AttacksIn October of 2016, I noted some of the suspicious activity surrounding America s biggest distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that was said to be caused by the malware Mirai. Given that there was a  hardcoded blacklist  of certain government entities and major multinational companies/defense contractors from being attacked   its seems more likely that the attack was US government created: Interestingly, according to Bradley Barth, a senior reporter for the IT security online magazine SC, the Mirai (supposedly leaked on September 30th) contains a very unique subset of characteristics that will not attack certain IP addresses such as the Department of Defense (DoD), the US Postal Service and consumer giant General Electric (GE) due to its coding: An Imperva analysis of the source code revealed several unique traits, including a hardcoded blacklist of IPs that the adversary did not want to attack, perhaps in order to keep a low profile. Some of these IPs belonged to the Department of Defense, the U.S. Postal Service and General Electric (GE). Though SC claims that the makers of Mirai may have been trying to keep a low profile, the recent DDoS attack attributed to the malware was as high-profile as you can get   so this begs the question, what was the real reason the malware creators put an IP blockade on the DoD, the Postal Service and GE? Is it possible that the DDoS attack originated from whitehat hackers associated with the US government, a major US defense contractor like GE or some other intelligence service, possibly the CIA?  HACKED?    Michael Hastings death sparked a wave of controversial theories. (Image source: pinterest)CIA Hacking Tools Upon closer inspection of the Wikileaks Vault 7 release, we see that in addition to the public s privacy apparently being invaded through the CIA s ability to bypass encryption on Android and iOS phones, computers and smart TVs   there was also the Wikileaks revelations exposing the agency s development of vehicular control.Wikileaks Vault 7 stated the following stunning revelation: As of October 2014 the CIA was also looking at infecting the vehicle control systems used by modern cars and trucks. The purpose of such control is not specified, but it would permit the CIA to engage in nearly undetectable assassinations. It is this part of Year Zero that has revived the conspiracy surrounding the death of investigative reporter and war veteran Michael Hastings, who died after his Mercedes C250 coupe supposedly burst into a giant fireball in the early hours of June 18 2013. According to eyewitness accounts, Hastings was going at a high rate of speed as  sparks and flames  were seen before his fiery automobile crashed.The UK s Sun recently revisited the Hastings tragedy. Here s a passage of that report: Hastings   a vocal critic of government mass surveillance   had sent an email to colleagues and friends just 12 hours earlier, telling them he was onto a  big story  and was under investigation.The Buzzfeed and Rolling Stone contributor, 33, wrote: The Feds are interviewing my  close friends and associates . May be wise to immediately request legal counsel before any conversations or interviews about our news-gathering practices. I m onto a big story and need to go off the radar for a bit. WikiLeaks also tweeted after the crash to say Hastings had contacted its lawyer Jennifer Robinson just before his death, claiming the FBI was investigating him.The FBI took a  departure from normal policy  to deny that Hastings had ever been under investigation after receiving a barrage of calls about his death. The CIA has failed to confirm or deny the authenticity of the Vault 7 release, only deepening the mystery surrounding the death of Hastings.The question of CIA control over cars and trucks naturally leads us to what was revealed regarding high-tech avionics in recent years  (Photo Illustration 21WIRE s Shawn Helton)Uninterruptible Flight ControlIn my article entitled  FLIGHT CONTROL: Boeing s  Uninterruptible Autopilot System , Drones & Remote Hijacking, I noted the CIA s involvement in certain advancements in flight technology. Lets revisit a portion of that article describing the agency s involvement: On December 4th of 2006, it was announced that Boeing had won a patent on an uninterruptible autopilot system for use in commercial aircraft. This was the first public acknowledgment by Boeing about the existence of such an autopilot system.The new autopilot patent was reported by John Croft for Flight Global, with the news piece subsequently linked by a Homeland Security News Wire and other British publications around the same time. According to the DHS release, it was disclosed that  dedicated electrical circuits  within an onboard flight system could control a plane without the need of pilots, stating that the advanced avionics would fly the aircraft remotely, independently of those operating the plane: The  uninterruptible  autopilot would be activated   either by pilots, by onboard sensors, or even remotely via radio or satellite links by government agencies like the Central Intelligence Agency, if terrorists attempt to gain control of a flight deck. Continuing, I outlined the suspicious nature of both the MH370 disaster and that of MH17. Since then there have been a number of strange airline catastrophes including Germanwings 9525 and EygptAir MS804. Following the apparent  vanishing act  of Malaysian Airlines flight MH370, many investigators and researchers began to question the likelihood of such an event happening in today s high-tech world.At 21WIRE, we ve also looked into the unprecedented disappearance of MH370 and the subsequent downing of MH17, as certain details came to light regarding the history of the remote autopilot function installed within Boeing commercial airliners (a subject which also opens the door to the events of 9/11).The Boeing 777 along with other Boeing models, can in fact be flown remotely through the use of independent embedded software and satellite communication. Once this advanced system is engaged, it can disallow any pilot or potential hijacker from controlling a plane, as the rooted setup uses digital signals that communicate with air traffic control, satellite links, as well as other government entities for the remainder of a flight s journey.This technology is known as the Boeing Honeywell  Uninterruptible  Autopilot System. Has the CIA had the ability to remotely hack vehicles for much longer than we think?The Wikileaks release once again opens questions about 9/11, the deep state and what intelligence agencies have control over in the War on Terror era.  CLOAKED    What other blueprints will Wikileaks provide regarding the CIA s capabilities? (Image Source: offgraun)Public Privacy Vs. the  Deep State In an article detailing the encryption saga between Apple and the FBI, we stated that there are no guarantees in the security world, especially if a digital master-key were to be created, as this would potentially make it easier for invaders (either the government, or various hackers) mining for data moving forward into the future.If the CIA has been secretly data mining just like the NSA, they have unquestionably violated the public s constitutional rights and trust.Is this really what the CIA has been up too?In a 2016 the Guardian interviewed some of those involved in the technology and security sector. These individuals offered their thoughts regarding the government s continued encroachment on individual privacy. here s another look at that passage:Dan Kaminsky, the security expert who made his name with the discovery that one of the most basic parts of the internet, the domain name system, was vulnerable to fraud   disagrees:  Feds want final authority on engineering decisions, and their interests don t even align with fighting the vast bulk of real-world crime. Continuing, The Guardian interviewed former FBI agent Michael German, currently the Brennan Center, a judicial think-tank. The following is a part of that interview: After 9/11, you had this concept of total information awareness. The intelligence community was very enamoured of the idea that all information was available. Much like the NSA, they wanted to see it all, collect it all, and analyse it all. Western political leaders and their media arms often discuss the dangers of so-called terror sleeper cells residing in a nation near you, but none of them acknowledge or attempt to explain the historical fact that for decades, they themselves have helped to harbor, grow, foment and radicalize individuals through their own clandestine  counter-terrorism  operations.Many of these operations have directly implicated security agencies (and military alliances) such as the FBI, CIA, MI5, MI6 and NATO   in the production of real terror.While most of these counter intelligence operations have fallen under the umbrella of the so-called War On Terror era, they have also largely served to obfuscate the nature of various government programs that some critics suggest is the work of a  deep state  apparatus.QUESTION: Will there be a large public outcry regarding the lack of oversight over the CIA s spying and hacking capabilities?Watch below as 21WIRE s Patrick Henningsen discusses the  NSA-like body  of the CIA on Peter Lavelle s Cross Talk show on RT In Summary The timely release of Vault 7 comes amid a flurry of wiretapping claims from President Donald Trump, while a review of US cyber capabilities and vulnerabilities is currently underway.Additionally, the Wikileaks Vault 7 publication revealed the following stunning information concerning the scope of the CIA s cyber capabilities previously unknown to the public: By the end of 2016, the CIA s hacking division, which formally falls under the agency s Center for Cyber Intelligence (CCI), had over 5000 registered users and had produced more than a thousand hacking systems, trojans, viruses, and other  weaponized  malware. Such is the scale of the CIA s undertaking that by 2016, its hackers had utilized more code than that used to run Facebook. The CIA had created, in effect, its  own NSA  with even less accountability and without publicly answering the question as to whether such a massive budgetary spend on duplicating the capacities of a rival agency could be justified. In 2012, then CIA Director David Petraeus, mused about the emergence of an  Internet of Things    that is, wired devices   at a summit for In-Q-Tel, the CIA s venture capital firm. The Wired magazine article continued, disclosing that the future of spying hinged on smart devices and a smart home: All those new online devices are a treasure trove of data if you re a  person of interest  to the spy community. Once upon a time, spies had to place a bug in your chandelier to hear your conversation. With the rise of the  smart home,  you d be sending tagged, geolocated data that a spy agency can intercept in real time when you use the lighting app on your phone to adjust your living room s ambiance. The public has long been prepped for the surreal level of surveillance we are only just beginning to understand, whether through books, film or tech magazines or by the government itself   the warning signs of lost privacy and protection have been hidden in plain sight for decades.Even still, Wikileaks Vault 7 shocks the avid researcher, writer and pundit as it gives further insight into the CIA s multi-pronged ability to distort the perception of the public, while vacuuming up all kinds of data.*** Author Shawn Helton is Associate Editor of 21st Century Wire, as well as an independent media forensic analyst specializing in criminal investigations and media coverage from war theaters.

"TEXAS CONGRESSMAN Lets Screaming Leftist Agitator Have It: “You sir, SHUT UP!” [Video]", 
" As ‘Me Too’ Posts Flood Social Media, Video Surfaces Of Trump Bragging About Hiring A ‘HOT’ Teenager","Everyone knows what a dirtbag Donald Trump is when it comes to women. His wives, his ex-wives, his mistresses, and even perfect strangers could literally all be participating in the #MeToo posts going on right now on Facebook and Twitter.The movement really took off after a tweet by actress Alyssa Milano:If you ve been sexually harassed or assaulted write  me too  as a reply to this tweet. pic.twitter.com/k2oeCiUf9n  Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) October 15, 2017Sophie Gilbert wrote an excellent piece in The Atlantic about the use of the tag to draw attention to the fact that not some, not many, but most women have had to endure some sort of sexual harassment in their everyday lives, and most of them many, many times.But in the middle of it all, another tweet came across the feeds of at least Scott Dworkin s quarter of a million followers on Twitter Monday morning. It s a recently uncovered video of Donald Trump back in 2007 giving a highly-paid speech to the Learning Annex. In it, a woman named Juliet in the audience at one point raises her hand during the Q&A portion of the event, and asks Trump, How many jets do you have and how might I apply to be a flight attendant? Seizing the opportunity to be the jackass he s been his whole life, skeevy Donald has the lovely young woman escorted to the stage. As she approaches, his face contorts into  appreciative  looks and he tells the audience,  I think she s hired, I don t know.  Leering at her body, he puts his arm around her and says, deadpan, You re hired. Trump then proceeds to tell the audience a story. I had a case, it was very interesting. A beautiful girl who was 17 or 18 and applied to be a waitress. So beautiful. She s like a world-class beauty like the young lady who just asked a question about the actress. She s so beautiful. And my people came and she said,  Mr. Trump, she has no experience.  So I interviewed her anyway because she was so pretty. And I said,  Let me ask you, do you have any experience?  She goes,  No, sir.  I say,  When can you start?' Before Juliet can leave the stage, presumably having been brought on purely as a prop for his anecdote, he squeezes her and kisses her. Then he stares at her body as she leaves the stage. This isn t my  interpretation  of what Trump is doing, you ll see in the video yourself. And as if making faces, raising his eyebrows, pursing his lips as he watches her walk away isn t enough, he turns back to the microphone and explains his  addiction  to women: See now, if she worked on my plane, that s like a death wish for me, right? That s like an alcoholic. People are alcoholics. You put Scotch in front of them, it s like [Trump waves his hands around the way he did while making fun of a disabled reporter], it s like, this would be my form of alcoholism. It is so sad that the biggest trend on social media right now is people sharing their stories of abuse publicly, just to spread awareness about how pervasive the problem is  And the country is being led by one of the biggest, most public perpetrators of that kind of abuse the world has ever known.Watch the video here:Featured image via Leon Neal/Getty Images"
" GOP Ex-Gov Of New Jersey Attacks Christie For Endorsing Trump, Will Vote Blue If He Wins","Donald Trump is causing mass chaos within the Republican Party as infighting over endorsements reaches a fever pitch.On Friday, New Jersey governor and former Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie threw his support behind Donald Trump, in spite of repeatedly attacking him while on the campaign trail.Gov. Christie s endorsement brought New Jersey s former governor Christie Whitman out of the woodwork on Sunday. She blasted Christie s endorsement of Trump, saying if he wins the party s nomination, she will be voting for Hillary Clinton.The former governor told nj.com, I am ashamed that Christie would endorse anyone who has employed the kind of hate mongering and racism that Trump has. I would have thought being from a diverse state would have given him more awareness and compassion. Christie claimed that if Trump wins the nomination, we ll see a lot of republicans back Hillary Clinton instead.Jeb Bush staffers also blasted Christie for endorsing Trump.David Kochel, Bush s chief strategist during his now-defunct campaign for the GOP nomination, blasted Christie on Twitter.Bush s former campaign spokesman posted a whole series of Tweets blasting Christie as well:Image credit: Tim Miller via TwitterTo be fair, Chris Christie isn t the only Republican to endorse Trump.Trump s also earned the endorsement of former Arizona Governor and all around crazy person, Jan Brewer. Not surprisingly, the former governor is most excited about Trump s delusional promise to build a wall along the Mexican border, which he says will keep out all the scary brown people.Maine s governor, Paul LePage, who is currently tied with Michigan Governor Rick Snyder for worst governor in the United States, has also endorsed Donald Trump. Like Christie, LePage publicly denounced Trump last week.Trump also has been endorsed by at least two Republican members of Congress. Rep. Chris Collins of New York praised Trump s understanding of  American exceptionalism,  while Rep. Duncan Hunter of California threw his support behind the candidate only after realizing that absolutely no-one was going to vote for Mike Huckabee.Trump also has earned endorsements from former half-term governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin, and the Daily Stormer, the country s most popular Neo-Nazi website.Meanwhile, South Carolina republican Lindsey Graham blasted everyone who supports Trump, saying that he s run out of adjectives to describe  how bad I think Donald Trump is for the party and for the country. As for Trump, during an interview with Good Morning America, he said that endorsements are  a waste of time. To prove it, as Christie attempted to take the stage at a Trump rally yesterday, apparently to announce his not-so-coveted endorsement, audio captured the GOP frontrunner telling Christie to get back on the plane and go home.Watch the hilarious video here.Image credit: Michael Vadon, via wikemedia commons"
GOP EVIDENCE: Comey FBI Busted Giving Clinton ‘Special Status’…Those Responsible STILL At FBI! [Video],"Friday on Fox News Channel s  Fox & Friends,  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) said evidence had been uncovered showing that the FBI gave the investigation of 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton s improper use of an unauthorized email server while secretary of state a  special status. According to the Florida Republican, who is also a member of the House Judiciary Committee, the process afforded to Clinton was different than it would have been for  any other American. We now have evidence that the FBI s investigation of Hillary Clinton did not follow normal and standard procedures,  he said.  The current deputy director of the FBI Andrew McCabe sent emails just weeks before the presidential election saying that the Hillary Clinton investigation would be special   that it would be handled by a small team at headquarters, that it would be given special status. GOETZ CALLED FOR AN IMMEDIATE INVESTIGATION: I am immediately calling for an investigation into the special treatment that the FBI gave Hillary Clinton. Rep. Gaetz: ""I am immediately calling for an investigation into the special treatment that the FBI gave Hillary Clinton."" #IngrahamAngle pic.twitter.com/EHkQfyeWDK  Fox News (@FoxNews) November 22, 2017Ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee Goetz is calling for an investigation into why Hillary Clinton s FBI case was labelled  special  by the FBI s Andrew McCabe:The Hill reports:Shortly before last year s election, FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe wrote an email on his official government account stating that the Hillary Clinton email probe had been given  special  status, according to documents released Wednesday.McCabe s Oct. 23, 2016, email to press officials in the FBI said the probe was under the control of a small group of high-ranking people at the FBI s headquarters in Washington. As I now know the decision was made to investigate it at HQ with a small team,  McCabe wrote in the email. He said he had no input when the Clinton email investigation started in summer 2015, while he was serving as assistant director in charge of the FBI s Washington office. [The Washington office] provided some personnel for the effort but it was referred to as a  special  and I was not given any details about it,  he wrote.FBI officials on Wednesday night refused to answer what McCabe meant by calling the Clinton email probe a  special  or why it was restricted to a small team at headquarters when it began. We don t have anything to add to the documents that were released,  bureau spokeswoman Carol Cratty wrote The Hill.The note was contained in more than 70 pages of emails the FBI released on its public records site known as The Vault.The emails chronicled McCabe s efforts to address a separate controversy involving his wife s 2015 campaign for political office.McCabe s references to a  special  status for the Clinton probe are likely to be used as ammunition by Republican lawmakers critical of former FBI Director James Comey s handling of the Clinton investigation.Remember that the DOJ s Loretta Lynch also wanted Clinton s case to be called an  incident  and not an investigation. It looks like all intel agencies were doing all they could to protect Clinton. Was it to save themselves from exposure in the Uranium One case or something else?"

 Incoming Trump Deputy Sec. Of State Blames Russian Hacking On Obama ‘False Flag’ (VIDEO),"If you ve ever wondered if Donald Trump is completely unqualified to make any decisions about anything involving the good of our nation, ever, look no further than incoming Deputy Secretary of State John Bolton (who fills in the  Crazed Conspiracy Theorist  box on your Apocalypse BINGO cards, if you re playing). On Sunday, Bolton appeared on Fox News to let the world know to ignore the CIA s evidence that Russia actively worked to install The Donald in the Oval Office because it s all big gubmint propaganda or something  a  false flag operation,  to be exact.Yes, this is a term that we have heard applied to the Sandy Hook shooting and pretty much anything that places conservatives in the uncomfortable position of having to self-analyze their horrific positions on guns, race, gender, and other topics. The phrase was largely made popular by Trump ally Alex Jones and deceased right-wing propagandist Andrew Breitbart (Yeah, the guy conservatives think Obama had killed for knowing too much. They ve even combined this conspiracy theory with the one about Hillary Clinton having child sex slaves in some circles. But I digress) and usually virtually assures that the person who uttered the term is a f*cking idiot.Which, of course, brings us to Bolton. It s not at all clear to me just viewing this from the outside that this hacking into the DNC and the RNC computers was not a false flag operation  are words actually uttered by someone Trump just placed in a very important position. Talking Points Memo provided a pretty handy transcript of what went down:BOLTON: It s not at all clear to me just viewing this from the outside that this hacking into the DNC and the RNC computers was not a false flag operation. Let s remember what FBI director James Comey said dealing with Hillary s home brew server. He said we found no direct evidence of foreign intelligence service penetration, but given the nature of this, we didn t expect to. Meaning, a really sophisticated foreign intelligence service would not leave any cyber fingerprints. And yet people say they did leave cyber fingerprints in the hacks regarding our election. So the question that has to be asked is why did the Russians run their smart intelligence service against Hillary s server but their dumb intelligence services against the election  SHAWN: When you say false flag, that s a very serious charge. False flag by whom? Here is  The Washington post.  The Post reported the CIA has concluded individuals with close ties to the Russian government hacked the e-mails. Intelligence officials have determined that Russia s goal was to help trump win rather than simply undermine confidence in the election. Are you actually accusing someone here in this administration of trying   in the intelligence community of trying to throw something?BOLTON: We just don t know, but I believe that intelligence has been politicized in the Obama administration to a very significant degree.SHAWN: Would the intelligence officials politicize this to go so far that could damage our republic and what we have for 200-plus years stood for.BOLTON: I think the whole thing is called into question and an independent investigation becomes extremely important. I think it s critical to answer the question I posed. If you think the Russians did this, then why did they leave fingerprints?SHAWN: Maybe because we have such sophisticated and  BOLTON: James Comey and the FBI couldn t find any fingerprints  SHAWN: They use a different standard. It s been shown they have a criminal start by the CIA has more of an intellectual  BOLTON: Let s hear the debate.SHAWN: What do you want to hear? Something from the CIA director?BOLTON: I d like to know. I think we have something now. We don t want to compromise intelligence sources and methods but when you make that kind of allegation, if it were true, and the Russians have the capability and the intention of doing it, I m not by any means trying to exonerate them, but if you say they ve done that, let me be clear, either in the cyber world or elsewhere, we should retaliate. It is unacceptable for the American constitution to be assaulted by foreigners in that way. So it is absolutely critical as well that we get the facts right on this, and I don t think we have anywhere enough in the public domain to know what the facts are.SHAWN: The president has ordered a review. Senator McCain and others of the Armed Services Committee are having hearings on this with the new congress. Let me read you a statement from both Senators McCain, SenatorsGraham, Schumer, and Jack Reed of Rhode Island, both bipartisan. For years foreign adversaries have directed cyber attacks at America s physical, economic, and military infrastructure while stealing our intellectual property. Now our institutions have been targeted. Recent reports of Russian interference in our election should alarm every American. This cannot become a partisan issue. The stakes are too high for our country. McCain this morning called Putin a thug, a killer, and a murderer. The president has ordered a public review. What are you calling on the president to do before January 20th? To reveal the classified information? To bring it all out so Americans can know if Russia had a hand in this election?BOLTON: One thing that makes me very nervous is Barack Obama saying let s have this report before the 20th of January so I can wrap it up. I think the burden for well or ill is going to fall on Mike Pompeo who has been named as president-elect trump s cia director. I think he s trusted by republicans and democrats. He doesn t bring any baggage. He s a new official at the CIA. I d look to him to head up an investigation across the entire intelligence committee. I just think these are such serious charges, again, if the Russians or any other foreign government think that they can undermine the integrity of our elections or defeat our constitutional process, this is just as serious an attack as a military attack.SHAWN: For those who are bothered by your claim of a potential false flag, that s very disturbing as an American.BOLTON: We would want to know who else might want to influence the election and why they would leave fingerprints that point to the Russians. That s why I say until we know more about how the insurance   intelligence community came to this conclusion  While he didn t say definitively that he believed this to be a  false flag,  Bolton made it clear that he might-or-might-not believe that President Obama   whose administration has a history of politicizing intelligence  to a very significant degree,  wink, wink   might or might not have told the CIA to falsely claim that Russia helped Donald Trump get elected because reasons. Makes perfect sense.Watch the interview below:Featured image via screengrab"
MEDALS OF VALOR: President Trump Honored Agents and Officers Who Took Down Gunman at GOP Baseball Practice Shooting [Video],"It s great to have a president who appreciates our special agents and police officers! Trump honored the police officers and special agents who took down the lunatic who shot Steve Scalise last month during a baseball practice for a charity game:Remember the horrible day that the lunatic opened fire trying to kill Republicans?Here s our report on the shooting:Rep. Steve Scalise was shot Wednesday morning in Alexandria, Virginia, in a  deliberate attack.  A congressional staffer was also shot. Scalise is in surgery right now and is expected to recover.Rand Paul said Scalise being there likely saved everyone because his presence meant Capitol Police were there.Scalise, a member of the House Republican leadership as the majority whip, appeared to have been shot in the hip and it appeared two Capitol Hill police agents were shot, according to Rep. Mo Brooks who was on deck when the shooting occurred. The shooting took place at a practice for the GOP congressional baseball team.NBC News Special Report: Congressman Scalise, aides shot at baseball practice in Virginia https://t.co/KD9i1iP9MZ  Jason Calabretta (@JasonCalabretta) June 14, 2017In a statement, Texas Rep. Roger Williams, one of the team s coaches, said one of his staff members was shot during the incident and is receiving medical attention. There was no information on the staffer s injuries.According to both congressional and law enforcement sources, the shooting appears to be a  deliberate attack. Two law enforcement sources say the suspect  is in police custody, has been taken to a hospital.Lawmakers who spoke at the scene to reporters described a normal morning practice, at a field where they ve practiced for years, when all of a sudden shots rang out. Lawmakers, staff members and even the young son of one of the members ran for cover, jumping into dugouts and over fences to avoid the gunshots.Congressmen in attendance described  an injured Scalise dragging himself roughly 15 yards away from second base and lying there until the shooter was shot. The Congressmen then ran to help him. Once they were able, Sen. Jeff Flake said he and Rep. Brad Wenstrup, who is a physician, went out to where Scalise was lying to apply pressure to the wound. Nobody would have survived without the Capitol Hill police. It would have been a massacre without them.  -Rand Paul  We had nothing but baseball bats to fight back against a rifle with.    Congressman Mo BrooksArizona Sen. Jeff Flake added that he saw a member of Scalise s security detail return fire on the gunman for what felt like 10 minutes, even though the police officer was wounded in the leg.  50 shots would be an understatement, I m quite sure,  Flake said when asked about the total amount of gunfire, including police returning fire. Flake said two members of Scalise s security detail were wounded, and another man was wounded in the chest. Brooks said the shooter appeared to be a white male but added that  I saw him for a second or two.  He said the shooter was behind the third base dugout and didn t say anything.  The gun was a semiautomatic,  Brooks said, adding that he was sure it was a rifle but unsure what kind.  It continued to fire at different people. You can imagine, all the people on the field scatter. It s come to this How will we bring America together if the Democrats keep fanning the flames of division?Read More: FOX News"

 WATCH: Hilarious Leaked Video Shows Australian PM Mocking Trump And It’s Now The Best Thing On The Internet,"During a private speech to journalists, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull let his inner comedian shine with a hilarious impersonation of Donald Trump. Not only does he nail the dialogue, he perfectly executes the portrayal down to Donald s awkward and childlike arrogance. The Donald and I, we are winning and winning in the polls,  he said Wednesday in a leaked video.  We are winning so much, we are winning, we are winning like we have never won before. The Journalists in attendance had agreed not to report or share the brilliant mockery they witnessed that night, but an editor from Nine Network couldn t help but share this gem with the world. I have this Russian guy.   Believe me, it s true, it is true,  added Turnbull, alluding to the Russian scandal playing out in the White House.In the wake of the backlash from the leaked video, Turnbull told Melbourne Talk Radio that his mockery was a light-hearted jest and a  good-humored roast.  He thinks people should  lighten up  about it.You can pretty much guarantee Trump won t be  lightening up  about this genius comedy act making fun of him in the best way possible.

MAXINE WATERS Gleefully Reveals Plan to Destroy Trump in Disturbing Interview [Video],"Rep. Maxine Waters said today that if Robert Mueller  does his job  and is able to prove collusion between President Donald Trump s campaign and the Russians, then  we ve got him. In an interview with MSNBC host and self-professed Waters fan Joy Reid, Waters reiterated that Democrats needed to work to remove Trump from office. Reid asked Waters if she had a sense that more Republicans in Congress were willing to  stand up  to Trump.Waters said she felt some Republicans did not know how to handle the situation or were simply waiting for the president to  implode. Many of them are not comfortable, and I believe that if Mueller does his job, if he s able to connect the dots, if he s able to show collusion, then we ve got him,  she said.  They will move away from him. Waters, a darling of progressives due to her constant calls for Trump s impeachment, has previously likened Mueller s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election to a contest of sorts. In an appearance Friday on MSNBC, she said Mueller is  going to win. Trump has consistently stated the Mueller probe is a  witch hunt  and pointed to the partisanship of the investigators on his team, although other Republicans have said Mueller s reputation is unquestioned.On  The View  last week, Waters said she welcomed the leaks coming from Trump s White House and was  so glad they re telling us what s going on.

WHOA! DID OPRAH JUST THROW Her Hat In The Ring To Challenge Donald Trump In 2020?,"Democrats have the perfect weapon to take down Donald Trump in 2020, according to a conservative columnist: Oprah. The famed black media proprietor and TV host was thrown into the political mix on Thursday when an op-ed in the New York Post suggested she is  uniquely positioned, should she wish to commit herself, to seek the Democratic nomination for president and challenge Trump in 2020. John Podhoretz, a never-Trump advocate and former speechwriter for Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, shared his essay on Twitter   and Oprah answered.

For one, Trump is not a race-obsessed and gender obsessed Democrat. Watch:Who can forget the interview Oprah did with Donald Trump on her show when she asked him if he d ever considering running for President. At the time of the interview, Donald J. Trump knew more about the real world and how it works, than Oprah, whose knowledge about how things work in the world ended with her Chicago set, and her on-stage couch where she practiced amateur psychology for decades in front of adoring fans.

"BREAKING NEWS: Woman Who Narrated BRUTAL TORTURE, Scalping of Mentally Disabled Young Man On Live Facebook Video Gets DISTURBING Sentence","When four Chicago thugs videotaped the brutal tortured a young mentally disabled man they kidnapped in a live Facebook video, Americans were stunned. Almost immediately after the discovery was made, the spokesperson for the Chicago Police Department called it a  stupid mistake .The superintendent of the building where the torture took place, shrugged off the horrific event by simply saying,  Kids make stupid mistakes. It looks like not much has changed in the attitudes of Chicago officials tasked with holding criminals accountable, especially in the case of four repulsive young thugs, who scalped the young 18-year old man, made him drink from a toilet, forced him to yell,  F*ck Trump  and  F*ck white people , and repeatedly hit him while his hands were tied and his mouth was covered with duct tape.The video is hard to watch but is an honest look at the anti-Trump and racist monsters who ve been given a pass by our media. Go HERE to watch the disturbing video. (***Warning***the video is very graphic).It was just announced that in a plea deal, Brittany Covington, 19, the narrator of the video, who had been held at the Cook County Jail without bond since January, will be the first of the four to be released. In a shocking case of injustice, the plea deal states that Covington will remain on probation for four years and is barred from contact with 2 of the other 3 co-criminals, Cooper and Hill, the Chicago Sun-Times is reporting.Other terms of the plea agreement bars Covington from using social media for four years, the Cook County State s Attorney s Office tells CBS 2.Brittany Covington narrated Facebook Live video of the others tormenting an 18-year-old white man in the apartment she shared with her sister.The victim, a Crystal Lake man who had been classmates with Hill at a west suburban alternative high school, appears terror-stricken as he was taunted with racially-tinged insults   including calling him a supporter of then-President-elect Donald Trump. Hill and Cooper allegedly cut his clothing with a knife, punched and kicked him. In another video, the man was forced to drink water from a toilet bowl.In one of the videos the defendants allegedly posted on Facebook, a man threatened the victim with a knife. Someone told the victim,  kiss the floor, b -!  and  nobody can help you anymore.  At one point, someone told the victim,  say  I love black people.   When a woman who lived in the building complained about the the noise and threatened to call the police, the sisters kicked in the woman s door in anger and took some of her property, police said. While the others had run to the other apartment, the victim managed to escape, and police found him, wearing shorts and his torn clothing in the January weather, a block away. Streamwood police officials say the victim s parents had made a missing-persons report after their son didn t return home.During the Streamwood police investigation, the victim s parents started  receiving text messages from persons claiming to be holding him captive,  officials said.Plea negotiations are ongoing with her three co-defendants, all of whom also have been in custody.

GOTCHA! SEN CLAIRE MCCASKILL Lied When She Said She Hadn’t Met With Russians,"Well, well, well  The Democrats are delusional with their wish for any scandal in the Trump administration Late today, President Trump reaffirmed his total support for Sessions. "
 Detroit Mayor Blasts Trump’s ‘Phony’ Black Church Visit,"Donald Trump, knowing that his poll numbers with black voters are abysmal, decided to spend part of his Saturday at a black church, Detroit s Great Faith International Ministries. However, it could not be more clear that he was in no way wanted there. Firstly, protesters showed up in throngs to condemn his visit, and then, the Democratic mayor, Mike Duggan, held a press conference slamming Trump s presence in his city. Duggan said: I feel like I m watching the next season of  The Apprentice.' This is the most phony major party nominee that I ve seen in my lifetime, and that s why we re skeptical. Trump s visit included a conversation with the church s Bishop, Wayne Jackson, and remarks to the congregation about how he supposedly will help African Americans (or perhaps just his way of saying how much he loves  the blacks ). Duggan, however, saw through the charade, and said of Trump s pandering: Are you here just to use Detroiters as props in a re-imaging campaign, or are you here to have a real conversation where you re finally going to give us the specifics on what you re going to do to make American cities better? Another local Democratic lawmaker, Rep. Brenda Lawrence, joined Duggan in his condemnation of Trump. She made a point of reminding everyone of the insulting language Trump uses when speaking of African Americans in his so-called  outreach.  Rep. Lawrence said: He said when he sees an African American that I am broke, I am unemployed, I m uneducated, and whenever I walk out my door I m being shot. What do I have to lose?  I don t want my grandchild to listen to the rhetoric that she, as a woman and as an African-American, is classified and stereotyped as uneducated. Of course, both Duggan and Lawrence are right. Trump is absolutely clueless. This visit, like all of his other events that are done anywhere except in front of all white audience where he s shouting about minorities and dog whistling racists, is nothing more than a photo-op, a way to gain a few votes from the gullible, and most importantly to make sure that suburban white America thinks he is just not racist enough for them to be able to vote for him with a clear conscience.Featured image via Aaron P.

JUST IN: CROOKED DOJ OFFICIAL Didn’t Reveal That His Wife Was Being Paid By Fusion GPS to Get Dirt on Trump [Video],"We ve been covering the curious case of DOJ official Bruce Ohr and his wife Nellie Ohr What they did is so corrupt and underhanded! Nellie worked for the opposition research firm hired by the Democrats to get dirt on Trump (see below). Her husband would take whatever Nellie produced about Trump and hand it over to the FBI! Unreal! This should be jail time because of the omission of the conflict of interest being an ethics violation. So far, it appears as though Bruce Ohr has just been demoted.NOW WE FIND OUT THAT BRUCE OHR HID THE FUSION GPS PAYMENTS TO HIS WIFE:Daily Caller reports:Bruce Ohr, the Department of Justice official who brought opposition research on President Donald Trump to the FBI, did not disclose that Fusion GPS, which performed that research at the Democratic National Committee s behest, was paying his wife, and did not obtain a conflict of interest waiver from his superiors at the Justice Department, documents obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation show.The omission may explain why Ohr was demoted from his post as associate deputy attorney general after the relationship between Fusion GPS and his wife emerged and Fusion founder Glenn Simpson acknowledged meeting with Ohr. Willfully falsifying government ethics forms can carry a penalty of jail time, if convicted.The Democratic National Committee (DNC) hired Fusion GPS to gather and disseminate damning info about Trump, and they in turn paid Nellie Ohr, a former CIA employee with expertise in Russia, for an unknown role related to the  dossier.  Bruce Ohr then brought the information to the FBI, kicking off a probe and a media firestorm.The DOJ used it to obtain a warrant to wiretap a Trump adviser, but didn t disclose to the judge that the DNC and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton s campaign had funded the research and that Ohr had a financial relationship with the firm that performed it   which could be, it turns out, because Ohr doesn t appear to have told his supervisors. Some have suggested that the financial payments motivated Bruce Ohr to actively push the case.OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON NELLIE OHR:This is a big deal even though we re sure the main stream media will ignore it. The connection between a now demoted DOJ official and Fusion GPS just got closer. His wife worked for the opposition research firm responsible for THE ANTI-TRUMP DOSSIER!

 Paul Krugman Shares The One Damning Truth About Corrupt Republicans We Can All Agree On (DETAILS),"The amount of corruption we have seen in Donald Trump s rise and presidency has been alarming, and it s not going to stop anytime soon.Even after suspiciously firing his FBI Director during an explosive investigation and having several high profile personal lawsuits, scandals and conflicts of interest, the Republican Party still has yet to hold Trump accountable for his faults. Whenever the GOP has had a chance to distance itself from Trump and do the right thing, spineless Republicans have failed to stand up and put their country first.In a Friday column in The New York Times, columnist Paul Krugman brilliantly pointed out the Republican Party s failing during Trump s presidency. Krugman states that today s GOP has become more about tax cuts for the rich than anything else, and conservatives will defend it at all costs. Arguing that Republicans no longer care about their country or its Constitution, Krugman wrote: This structure rewards, indeed insists on, absolute fealty. What this means is that nearly all Republicans in today s Congress are apparatchiks, political creatures with no higher principle beyond party loyalty. We ve certainly seen this play out in the way that Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and other prominent Republicans refuse to hold erratic Trump accountable even as his scandals and behavior put the country at risk. But even if Trump were to be impeached, Krugman warns,  the threat to the Republic will be far from over.  Krugman states that Trump s idiocy may have actually helped the country stay away from more sinister Republican values: In a perverse way, we should count ourselves lucky that Trump is as terrible as he is. The point is that given the character of the Republican Party, we d be well on the way to autocracy if the man in the White House had even slightly more self-control. Trump may have done himself in; but it can still happen here. We hate to say it, but he s probably right.Featured image via Mark Wilson / Getty Images"
" Adele Brings Whole Crowd Together To Dedicate Song To Brussels, And It’s Breathtaking (VIDEO)","When there are those who are injured and killed in terror attacks, there will also be those who stand behind them in solidarity to show their unending love and support. No greater example of this was exhibited than on Tuesday night in London s O2 arena when Adele dedicated a song to the city of Brussels, Belgium and got the entire crowd to sing along with her.Brussels is the latest city to feel the sting of those who see harming others as a means to be heard and get their way. These terrorists are cruel, yet unfortunately, no longer unusual. Too many of these attacks are occurring and there needs to be a united effort to stop the spread of terror across the globe.One way to show these inhumane monsters that their terror will not affect life as we know it, is by sticking together in times of need and moving forward with a bond that is greater than anything hatred can foster. By dedicating her song  Make You Feel My Love  to the city of Brussels and having the entire arena sing along while waving light proves that age-old saying from Martin Luther King, Jr.: Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that. And this is, by far, one of the most perfect examples of such light and love. At the end, Adele was so touched that she said,  I don t think I ve ever actually been so moved in my life at one of my shows that was just so beautiful.  And it really, truly was.We re all standing with you Brussels.Featured image via YouTube"
100% FED UP! WITH HILLARY 2016? WE’VE GOT THE AWESOME ANSWER AND REASONS #WHYIMNOTVOTINGFORHILLARY,"Yada, yada, yada  Hillary Clinton announced her 2016 presidential bid in a two-minute video that she uploaded to YouTube. Is everyone else as 100% FED Up! with the Hillary 2016 push from the main stream media? Yep, I thought so BUT THIS IS AWESOME AND YOU SHOULD PARTICIPATE ON TWITTER: Within minutes of her announcement, Twitter blew up with the following hashtag: #WhyImNotVotingForHillary. It quickly became the number one trending hashtag.In honor of this awesome hashtag, here is a list of some of the best reasons why Americans are choosing to NOT vote for Hillary Clinton: America should not be run by crooks. She hasn t cared about the Middle Class in 70 years. She s starting now???? I support women! That includes the unborn in the womb. I won t support anyone that supports Planned Parenthood. When terrorists murdered a US ambassador and 3 other Americans, her response was,  What difference does it make? She takes money from countries that execute homosexuals and oppress women. She couldn t satisfy her husband how is she going to satisfy a whole country? Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, Sean Smith, Tyrone Woods, and Glen Doherty. Because she s morally bankrupt! Judge Jeanine: Hillary Clinton is only out for herself. She is the poster child for what s wrong with our government. She is a criminal. She is a liar. She has accomplished nothing. I don t believe in socialism. The left believes in the supremacy of govt over the individual. Do you want tyranny or liberty? I don t believe in political dynasties. Because God must be ignored to adopt her   Ends Justifies the Means   ideology. She is Bill and Obama but without the charm. Enough is too much already. Corruption, incompetence, dishonesty, elitism  just a few reasons. As a Hispanic, black woman I feel insulted by Dems who feel my needs are only abortion, immigration and racism. Because her greatest accomplishment has been accomplishing nothing worthy of our votes. I ve taken European History. I know the dangers of a socialist leader. Because she s worse than Caligula. Worse than the Oakland Raiders. Worse than Obamacare. Almost as bad as cancer.  Boo yah!Please feel free to join in on the trend and issue your own #WhyImNotVotingForHillary tweet!Via: Down Trend"
THE LOST VIDEO: Watch MSNBC’S Mika Shamelessly Flirt With Donald Trump [VIDEO],"With all the anger and nasty comments coming from Mika and Joe of MSNBC, the video below makes you wonder if the nasty Mika is just an act Ya think? These two media wh*res couldn t be happier that now they re in the spotlight.The change has been huge Mika has called President Trump every nasty thing in the book:Hour one of the MSNBC morning show began typically enough with Mika and Joe. The assembled gang could barely contain their glee at the prospect of damning testimony from James Comey. That all set the stage for a typical Mika Brzezinski tirade that was honestly one of the most disgusting assaults on President Trump yet. It s unhinged hate!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZoUCHs22Aw I think Trump is such a narcissist, it s possible he is mentally ill in a way and this is on the table, I said it months ago and now everyone is starting to say it like it s new, and it s ok to say. He s not well,  she said.  At the very least, he s not well. And he s so narcissistic he does not believe the rules apply to him, and that s where the ignorance label may apply because this is a man who says he can grab women anywhere because he s famous. Then something very curious happened.Scarborough looked off camera and can be heard saying,  What s that? Wow,  Then Willie Geist showed him something and the two started laughing. Then a clearly not listening Scarborough, banged the table. Stop right there,  he laughed  I need an eject button. He posted it?  Scarborough appeared to ask someone else?Brzezinski finally realized that nobody was listening to her and demanded an explanation. Nothing I have said is crazy,  she said. We ll talk about it in the break,  said Scarborough barely able to get it out through his own laugher.The show soon went to break. When it returned Scarborough joked about  keeping it in the guard rails. Brzezinski appeared to offer an explanation of her actions.  I am keeping it in the guard rails. Everything I ve said you all have thought and you know and you ve said in your own way. You re going to talk to me about a filter?  she snapped at Scarborough."
BREAKING: WHY DID MASSACHUSETTS OFFICIALS WAIT SO LONG To Release This Video Showing Thug Shooting Police Officer In Face? [VIDEO],"Where was the media coverage when this black thug shot a white police officer in the face? It clearly doesn t fit their narrative which explains why this horrific incident took place on March 27, 2015 and the video is just being released today Massachusetts officials on Friday released video footage showing the near-fatal shooting of a Boston police officer last month by a man who was subsequently shot dead by other officers.The decision to release the footage comes amid protests in several major U.S. cities over a series of killings of civilians in recent months. The latest occurred last Saturday when a white officer in South Carolina was videotaped shooting an unarmed black man as he fled after a traffic stop. It is in everyone s best interest to share (this) information as soon as possible in order to tamp down speculation and rumors meant to inflame and not inform,  Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley said at a news conference.The video shows six-year Boston Police Department veteran John Moynihan and two colleagues approaching a car stopped at about 6:40 p.m. on March 27 in Boston s Roxbury neighborhood.As Moynihan stands near the driver s door, a man identified by police as 41-year-old Angelo West jumps out of the vehicle, shoots Moynihan in the face and runs out of the camera frame as Moynihan falls to the ground.Authorities say West, who had a criminal record including prior gun charges, was shooting at police as he ran and that Moynihan s fellow officers returned fire, killing him.Moynihan, 34, is recovering after surgery to remove a bullet lodged in his neck.Local leaders at the news conference said that anger toward police over the incident was minimal. We need to be very aware that the work of police officers is indeed very dangerous,  said Rev. Mark Scott, of the Azusa Christian Community in Boston s Dorchester neighborhood.He called West s death  tragic,  but added that once someone pulls a gun on a police officer,  you don t leave the police any other option but to respond. The Suffolk District Attorney s office is investigating the shootings and has said it will release a full report on the incident later.Via: Reuters"
Santilli Freed Under Plea Pact as Vegas Shooting Casts Shadow on Bundy Trial," LONG SHADOW: The wake of the recent mass tragedy in Las Vegas has overtaken various current events, including the Bundy Trial (Image: Mandalay Bay Hotel & Resort) By Mark Anderson The TRUTH HOUNDLAS VEGAS Although the ongoing Bundy trial in the U.S. District Court in Las Vegas, Nevada has had its share of dramatic changes, that s especially true lately.A major twist is that internet-radio personality Pete Santilli   one of seven defendants in the trial that had been set to begin with jury selection on Oct. 10th before it was delayed again  plead guilty (on Friday, Oct. 6) and was released pending sentencing,  confirmed his attorney, Chris Rasmussen of Las Vegas.Rancher Cliven Bundy held without trial for over 18 months.In that highly anticipated trial, with Santilli now excluded due to his plea, the federal government is trying elder rancher Cliven Bundy (image, left), his sons Ammon and Ryan, and  militia leader  Ryan Payne. Two other defendants, O. Scott Drexler and Eric Parker, who are being retried for a third time from earlier proceedings will join the others in this second of three planned trials.Another development affecting the trial is concern that the Oct. 1st mass shooting at Mandalay Bay Hotel might prevent the defendants from getting a fair shake. According to Ryan Payne s attorney, the Vegas shooting has the potential to bias jurors, and has asked that the trial be moved to Nevada s second largest city, Reno, located seven hours north of Las Vegas.But while moving the proceedings 450 miles away to Reno s federal court appears unlikely as of this writing, the Las Vegas federal court issued yet another delay in this complicated trial. Therefore, the previously announced Oct. 10 date for jury selection for the second trial will be changed to on, or around, Oct. 30th.And even that could be subject to change again, given the already bumpy track record of this multiple-defendant case   in which the federal government has had a hard time making its allegations stick.Only Gregory Burleson, who s wheelchair-bound and reportedly has developed blindness, has been sentenced   to 68 years, no less. He was convicted in the first trial that began in early February. A co-defendant in that trial, Todd Engel, is expected to be sentenced Dec. 22, though several other defendants have been cleared of numerous charges.SANTILLI S JOURNEYSantilli, who shot extended livestream video footage at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge building near Burns, Oregon, was held on remand for his role in that latter-2015, early-2016 affair.The controversial internet radio personality has had his share of critics, both in and out of the court room. Some critics alleged that his some of the  journalistic  coverage shot in Oregon enabled the government to more closely monitor the Bundys and their supporters who had peacefully occupied the abandoned building to protest onerous federal land controls and the unlawful arrest of the Hammonds, local ranchers who had fallen foul of federal agents from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Others, however, felt his coverage would have provided a helpful account of events had federal agents decided to take the building by force. During the Oregon hearings, his defense attorney argued that much footage which he had broadcast on his YouTube channel should be considered as protected speech under the First Amendment.On the eve of last September s Oregon trial   Santilli had all charges dismissed against him.Although later cleared of Oregon-related charges, Santilli remained in federal custody and was transferred to Nevada to stand trial for his role in the famous spring 2014  standoff  at Bundy Ranch in Bunkerville, Nevada   an event that saw Cliven Bundy, his sons and other supporters gather to protest the policies of the BLM and other  agencies.Federal agents unsuccessfully attempted to confiscate Cliven s cattle over alleged claims that he owed significant federal grazing fees, and concerning a EPA court order over a contested environmental mitigation policy concerned the relocation of the Desert Tortoise. From the onset of the controversy, Cliven Bundy has maintained the federal government lacks jurisdiction in that part of southern Nevada and that the fees don t apply, citing legal and historical matters.Santilli: released before the trial.In Nevada, Santilli pleaded guilty to Count 2   a single felony count of obstruction of justice, based on the government s claim that he used his own vehicle to impede the movement of an approaching BLM convoy during the attempted cattle impoundment. Interestingly, during that incident, after the convoy stopped, federal agents and their guard dogs were then confronted by members of the Bundy family and their supporters. Santilli then filmed the altercation   including federal agents tasering Ammon Bundy, and posted it on YouTube, which went instantly viral, garnering nearly 1.5 million views in just a few days. The video was then syndicated on FOX News and other national outlets. Many had credited Santilli s original video entitled,  Ranch Riot as one of the key catalysts for the one thousand or so supporters and militia who then arrived at Bundy Ranch over the following 72 hours before the standoff on April 12, 2014.Like all the other defendants, he was initially charged with all 16 counts contained in the original federal complaint   which carried a potential maximum sentence of life in prison, upon conviction for all or most of those counts.Interestingly, Santilli s attorney, Mr. Rasmussen, motioned in court, and later told this writer, that the government may consider the prison time that Santilli has already served   behind bars since Jan. 26, 2016   as either sufficient punishment for that felony charge in a best-case scenario, or the court may at least consider giving him credit for that time served, even if he s given a longer sentence at his expected sentencing hearing on Jan. 11, 2018 at 8 a.m.PLEA BARGAIN DETAILSA reading of the plea agreement shows that the government reserves the right to impose a longer prison term, possibly six years, on Santilli.Also, Rasmussen noted that residing Judge Gloria Navarro is not bound by the agreement s recommendations, meaning she could choose to alter them when she sentences Santilli.Meanwhile, two pending defense motions   one to exclude Oregon-related evidence in the government s Nevada case against Santilli, and another to challenge the government s claim that Santilli could not excuse his Nevada actions because of his journalistic background   have become moot due to this plea bargain, Rasmussen added.The agreement s terms may raise the question of whether the other defendants  actions will be seen in a more negative light, given the fact that Santilli s guilty plea to the felony-obstruction charge requires   under penalty of perjury   that he accept the following government-sourced narrative as  true and correct. The maximum penalty for  Conspiracy to Impede or Injure a Federal Officer,  as this count against Santilli is formally named under 18 U.S.C.  372, is six years imprisonment, a fine of $250,000, or both.But in the shifting sands of these proceedings, the understanding at this juncture is that Santilli will owe neither a fine nor restitution, nor will there be forfeiture of his assets   provided he meets the terms of his release until he s sentenced. Although according to Rasmussen, Santilli will not be electronically monitored, despite speculation that he would be tagged.RETURNING TO INTERNET RADIONotably, Santilli, who is expected to return to his hometown of Cincinnati, Ohio, during the week starting Monday Oct. 16, will reportedly be allowed, at least for the time being, to resume broadcasting his news content.Asked if Santilli would be able to comment on the Bundy trial itself, Rasmussen replied in writing:  He can do whatever he wants as long as he s not committing crimes.  The First Amendment allows him to comment on anything unless it is threatening or inciting violence. Furthermore, attorney Rasmussen said that Santilli is under a  self-imposed  gag order, not a government-imposed one, meaning he has chosen not to talk to reporters.Also, Santilli will not testify against the other defendants and will not have to turn over his journalistic  work products,  but only  raw discovery  information from court proceedings. And the plea bargain stresses he must remain crime-free regarding federal, state and local laws and among other things must avoid any known association with anyone who s breaking any law. The plea agreement also restricts him from significant travel   initially only between southern Nevada and Cincinnati, Ohio.Nor can Santilli possess a gun or any other item deemed by the government as a weapon. Just failing to show up for a hearing or some other procedural matter, let alone larger infractions, could result in this deal being dissolved.STAY TUNED FOR MORE UPDATESREAD MORE BUNDY RANCH NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Bundy Ranch FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE  SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @ 21WIRE.TV"
 Why The Secret Service Is Investigating Glenn Beck (VIDEO),"The United States Secret Service is investigating conspiracy theorist and right wing radio host Glenn Beck. The probe is in relation to a statement Beck made on his nationally syndicated radio show while broadcasting from the CPAC conference.The agency is required to investigate any and all threats related to the people it is protecting, in this case it happens to be comments Beck made about Donald Trump, who Beck is opposed to. From CBS Dallas:During his radio show Friday morning, Beck and his producers were talking about the other candidates saying they would support Donald Trump if he becomes the Republican nominee.His producer mocked Beck after Beck mentioned being in the shoes of Trump s rivals: Was it gigantic shoes?  asked the producer Stu Burguiere. If I was close enough and I had a knife. Really. I mean the stabbing just wouldn t stop,  Beck responded, appearing to direct his comments at Burguiere.Beck s comments were blasted out by the conservative Daily Caller, which is run by Fox News host Tucker Carlson.But unlike so many other inflammatory statements from Beck, this may actually be a mistake. Beck was apparently talking about his producer, Stu Burguiere. Burguiere posted on his Facebook page after the incident noting,  If you were listening, you know that Glenn actually threatened me, not Donald Trump, so I am in the odd situation of defending my boss for threatening my life. The comments may have been seen as more credible because Beck has been a critic of Trump, claiming that his preferred candidate, Ted Cruz, is more qualified and destined for the presidency than Trump. Beck has accused Trump of being a huckster and a phony.It seems fitting that a conservative media outlet s sloppy reporting led to federal law enforcement being called in on another conservative media icon.Beck has for years promoted conspiracy theories about President Obama, Democrats, and other progressives. He also claimed that Obama hates white people and that he has been using the power of the government to give black people reparations. Beck s theories were so out there that advertisers began abandoning his afternoon show on Fox News, and the network soon dropped him. Now he broadcasts online and on a few niche cable networks, while still retaining his radio show   but even that is dwarfed by more successful hosts like Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity.Featured image via Flickr"
N KOREA JUST REVEALED Plans To Unleash An Unimaginable  Attack That Could Lead To Electronic Armageddon,"WFB  North Korea for the first time this week revealed plans for using its nuclear arms for space-based electronics-disrupting EMP attacks, in addition to direct warhead ground blasts.The official communist party newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, published a report Monday on  the EMP might of nuclear weapons,  outlining an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack produced by detonating a nuclear warhead in space. In general, the strong electromagnetic pulse generated from nuclear bomb explosions between 30 kilometers and 100 kilometers [18.6 miles and 62 miles] above the ground can severely impair electronic devices, electric machines, and electromagnetic grids, or destroy electric cables and safety devices,  said the article authored by Kim Songwon, dean of Kim Chaek University of Technology in Pyongyang. The discovery of the electromagnetic pulse as a source of high yield in the high-altitude nuclear explosion test process has given it recognition as an important strike method,  he stated.The official discussion by North Korea of plans to conduct EMP strikes will likely fuel debate over the threat. Former CIA Director James Woolsey has said North Korea is capable of orbiting an EMP nuclear weapon in a satellite.Some liberal arms control advocates have dismissed the EMP threat from Pyongyang as far-fetched, such as arms control advocate Jeffrey Lewis, who in April dismissed the threat of an EMP attack by laughing at a reporter s question.  This is the favorite nightmare scenario of a small group of very dedicated people,  he told NPR.Disclosure of North Korea s intention to use its nuclear force for EMP attacks comes as U.S. intelligence agencies are continuing to analyze the latest underground nuclear test by North Korea on Sept. 3 that the regime said was its first hydrogen bomb explosion.Senior administration officials said initial assessments of the nuclear blast in northeastern North Korea indicate it was the largest test detonation so far, and much larger than an underground test carried out last year. It was the regime s sixth nuclear test.U.S. nuclear technicians have not made a definitive conclusion about the specifics of the device. Specialists are trying to determine if the test involved a hydrogen bomb, as Pyongyang asserted, or a device designed for EMP attack. They are also assessing whether the test used boosted fission technology.Hydrogen bombs are advanced devices that use a two-stage explosion process to produce a massive explosion. Boosted fission devices are less sophisticated technologically and require more nuclear fuel. We re highly confident this was a test of an advanced nuclear device and what we ve seen so far is not inconsistent with North Korea s claims,  a U.S. intelligence official said.However, a final conclusion on the type and yield of the blast is not expected for several days. Data from the test is being analyzed by nuclear weapons experts at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.Also, the large explosion perhaps more than 100 kilotons, or the equivalent of 100 tons of TN likely produced significant venting of radioactive particles into the air.Special U.S. intelligence aircraft, including the WC-135 nuclear  sniffer  jets, are conducting flights near the test zone to gather samples of particles from the test.EXPERTS ARE SAYING AN EMP ATTACK BY N KOREA IS A VERY REAL AND DARK POSSIBILITYAccording to the Business Insider, some experts believe that the more realistic threat at this point in time is an EMP attack. To make that happen, all North Korea has to do is launch a low-yield nuclear missile from a submarine, ship, or even by balloon and explode it at high altitude, above the atmosphere.The potential result: a blackout of the Eastern grid that supplies 75% of power to the United States.If an EMP attack did take place, it would be beyond anything we have seen before. The Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from Electromagnetic Pulse Attack, which was established by Congress in 2001, estimates that within 12 months following a nationwide blackout,  up to 90% of the US population could perish from starvation, disease, and societal breakdown. Electronic ArmageddonIn practical terms, a catastrophic blackout would be worst in cities, because it would instantly deprive the population of access to drinking water, refrigeration, heat, air conditioning, and telecommunication. Food stores would be looted within a matter of days, and gas stations would cease to function without electricity.Without Internet access and power, all commerce and advanced methods of communication would stop. There would be no TV, radio, phones. Credit card transactions and cash withdrawals at banks would be impossible. Paper money would become worthless, and Bitcoin would cease to exist, along with the stock market.Newt Gingrich, speaking at the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources earlier this month, said an EMP attack  would send us back to the 18th century. But that s not the only problem. If no outside help arrives, within days, chaos begins to reign. Civilization is a rather thin veneer that humans have acquired over centuries, a mask covering our hard-wired survival instincts. Once the mask slips, it could mean the end of the world as we know it.We are Ill-Prepared For An EMP AttackUS politicians and major utilities have kicked the can down the road when it comes to EMP preparation. Edison Electric estimates that shielding transformers for the US grid system could cost $20 billion.Granted, American power companies have been studying ways to protect our electronic grids against attack, but tangible results are slow in coming.The only current option after an EMP attack would be to replace damaged or destroyed transformers. However, says Scott Aaronson, managing director for Cyber and Infrastructure Security at Edison Electric, replacements for those transformers must be procured from foreign suppliers, which could take up to 18 months.Peter Vincent Pry, leader of the Task Force on National and Homeland Security, believes North Korea is closer to launching an EMP attack than many analysts believe. He wants Congress to work harder and cut the red tape to allow the innovation necessary to mitigate the threat.In Pry s opinion, an EMP attack would ultimately kill more Americans than a direct nuclear blast could. His book, The Long Sunday, describes several plausible EMP attack scenarios.Pry thinks that  the first nation to use nuclear weapons today even a rogue state like North Korea or Iran will immediately become the most feared and credible nuclear power in the world, a formidable force to be reckoned with, and perhaps the dominant actor in a new world order. Is there a sensible way to prepare for an EMP attack?Maybe not, but stocking some food, water, fuel, and batteries for emergencies is always a good idea as well as owning a stash of gold coins as hard assets.While  you can t eat gold,  as some preppers say, it is the only kind of money that has prevailed over the millennia. Kim, the North Korean technical university dean, stated that high-altitude explosions can be conducted in the stratosphere or in space where the blast wave is limited by the lack of air or the thinness of air. In explosions occurring at such altitudes, large amounts of electrons are released as a result of ionization reactions of high-energy instant gamma rays and other radioactive rays,  he said.  These electrons form a strong electromagnetic pulse (EMP) through interaction with the geomagnetic field. The detonation would create a strong electric field of 100,000 volts per meter when it approaches the ground and  that is how it destroys communications facilities and electricity grids,  the report said.The EMP report was published Monday, a day after the same state-run outlet reported on a visit by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to a nuclear weapons facility that also mentioned plans for using nuclear weapons in EMP attacks. Our hydrogen bomb whose power as a nuclear bomb can be adjusted at will from tens of kilotons to hundreds of kilotons according to the targets of strike is a multifunctional thermonuclear warhead which not only has enormous lethality and destructibility, but also can even carry out super-powerful EMP attack over an expansive area through detonation at high altitudes according to strategic goals,  the report said.

EXPLODING AFRICAN REFUGEE POPULATION STRESSING WELFARE SYSTEM IN MINNESOTA Are Sending Millions Of Dollars Back To Africa,"It s not just the our open southern borders we need to be concerned about. It s our State Department who seems to be hell-bent on populating our states with refugees from mostly muslim nations in Africa and the Middle East.This is one of those feel-good stories about how Minnesota is such a wonderful state with its ever-expanding African migrant population. If you are a Minnesotan it s probably a good thing to read.However, I caution readers on the numbers. The TwinCities Pioneer Press reports that there are about 85,000 Somalis in the whole US and that just isn t so the number is much larger. We painstakingly researched the numbers for just those entering the US through the refugee program and came up with over 100,000 in the last 25 years and that doesn t include a couple generations now of producing children. See this early post.You will see mention in the story that when census takers come around, the Africans are less than truthful about how many are living at the location.From TwinCities Pioneer Press:Of the 50 states, Minnesota has the ninth-largest population of African immigrants. About 60 percent come from East African nations such as Somalia and Ethiopia, and 25 percent from West African nations such as Nigeria and Liberia. The rest come from elsewhere in Africa.Of more than 85,700 Somalis officially known to reside in the U.S., nearly a third are thought to reside in Minnesota.Corrie, a professor at Concordia University in St. Paul, believes the state s African population produces $14 million in philanthropy within Minnesota each year, on top of $150 million in annual remittances to countries in Africa.I don t know why this is considered a good thing sending money out of America that will never benefit our economy!Some of the  smart  people on our side should get to work doing studies that will show the real picture including how much welfare is consumed by the immigrants, how costly is their medical care and education, the cost to the criminal justice system, and include an analysis of where the money goes!I m starting to think that glowing reports about how immigrants benefit the local economy include the money flowing into a state like Minnesota from the federal tax payer via welfare programs. Someone needs to find out!By the way, I don t see any mention in the Pioneer Press story about the fact that half of the state s Somalis live in poverty, here. Via: Refugee Resettlement WatchThe State Department has helped to relocate tens of thousands of refugees from the war-torn African nation of Somalia to Minnesota, where they can take advantage of some of America s most generous welfare and charity programs.But the effort is having the unintended consequence of creating an enclave of immigrants with high unemployment that is both stressing the state s safety net and creating a rich pool of potential recruiting targets for Islamist terror groups.

Hannity told his audience,  Let me put it this way, if I m Hillary or fake news, I won t be sleeping well tonight. Watch:.@seanhannity TICK TOCK Tonight Folks  Get ready @HillaryClinton  pic.twitter.com/PxbRCgyPwm  'GITMO' BAMA   (@President1Trump) October 17, 2017Well, John Solomon and Alison Spann s story did indeed break first thing today in The Hill, and it s a doozy. Will justice finally be delivered to these corrupt, anti-American, self-serving and lying players? Not providing information on a corruption scheme before the Russian uranium deal was approved by U.S. regulators and engage appropriate congressional committees has served to undermine U.S. national security interests by the very people charged with protecting them. The Russian efforts to manipulate our American political enterprise is breathtaking.    Former House Intelligence Chair Mike Rogers (R-MI)The Hill   Before the Obama administration approved a controversial deal in 2010 giving Moscow control of a large swath of American uranium, the FBI had gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering designed to grow Vladimir Putin s atomic energy business inside the United States, according to government documents and interviews.Federal agents used a confidential U.S. witness working inside the Russian nuclear industry to gather extensive financial records, make secret recordings and intercept emails as early as 2009 that showed Moscow had compromised an American uranium trucking firm with bribes and kickbacks in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, FBI and court documents show.They also obtained an eyewitness account   backed by documents   indicating Russian nuclear officials had routed millions of dollars to the U.S. designed to benefit former President Bill Clinton s charitable foundation during the time Secretary of State Hillary Clinton served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to Moscow, sources told The Hill.The racketeering scheme was conducted  with the consent of higher level officials  in Russia who  shared the proceeds  from the kickbacks, one agent declared in an affidavit years later.Rather than bring immediate charges in 2010, however, the Department of Justice (DOJ) continued investigating the matter for nearly four more years, essentially leaving the American public and Congress in the dark about Russian nuclear corruption on U.S. soil during a period when the Obama administration made two major decisions benefitting Putin s commercial nuclear ambitions.The first decision occurred in October 2010, when the State Department and government agencies on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States unanimously approved the partial sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to the Russian nuclear giant Rosatom, giving Moscow control of more than 20 percent of America s uranium supply.When this sale was used by Trump on the campaign trail last year, Hillary Clinton s spokesman said she was not involved in the committee review and noted the State Department official who handled it said she  never intervened   on any [Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States] matter. In 2011, the administration gave approval for Rosatom s Tenex subsidiary to sell commercial uranium to U.S. nuclear power plants in a partnership with the United States Enrichment Corp. Before then, Tenex had been limited to selling U.S. nuclear power plants reprocessed uranium recovered from dismantled Soviet nuclear weapons under the 1990s Megatons to Megawatts peace program. The Russians were compromising American contractors in the nuclear industry with kickbacks and extortion threats, all of which raised legitimate national security concerns. And none of that evidence got aired before the Obama administration made those decisions,  a person who worked on the case told The Hill, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by U.S. or Russian officials.The Obama administration s decision to approve Rosatom s purchase of Uranium One has been a source of political controversy since 2015.That s when conservative author Peter Schweitzer and The New York Times documented how Bill Clinton collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in Russian speaking fees and his charitable foundation collected millions in donations from parties interested in the deal while Hillary Clinton presided on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.The Obama administration and the Clintons defended their actions at the time, insisting there was no evidence that any Russians or donors engaged in wrongdoing and there was no national security reason for any member of the committee to oppose the Uranium One deal.But FBI, Energy Department and court documents reviewed by The Hill show the FBI, in fact, had gathered substantial evidence well before the committee s decision that Vadim Mikerin   the main Russian overseeing Putin s nuclear expansion inside the United States   was engaged in wrongdoing starting in 2009.Then-Attorney General Eric Holder was among the Obama administration officials joining Hillary Clinton on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States at the time the Uranium One deal was approved. Multiple current and former government officials told The Hill they did not know whether the FBI or DOJ ever alerted committee members to the criminal activity they uncovered.Spokesmen for Holder and Clinton did not return calls seeking comment. The Justice Department also didn t comment.Mikerin was a director of Rosatom s Tenex in Moscow since the early 2000s, where he oversaw Rosatom s nuclear collaboration with the United States under the Megatons to Megwatts program and its commercial uranium sales to other countries. In 2010, Mikerin was dispatched to the U.S. on a work visa approved by the Obama administration to open Rosatom s new American arm called Tenam.Between 2009 and January 2012, Mikerin  did knowingly and willfully combine, conspire confederate and agree with other persons   to obstruct, delay and affect commerce and the movement of an article and commodity (enriched uranium) in commerce by extortion,  a November 2014 indictment stated.His illegal conduct was captured with the help of a confidential witness, an American businessman, who began making kickback payments at Mikerin s direction and with the permission of the FBI. The first kickback payment recorded by the FBI through its informant was dated Nov. 27, 2009, the records show. The investigation was ultimately supervised by then-U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein, an Obama appointee who now serves as President Trump s deputy attorney general, and then-Assistant FBI Director Andrew McCabe, now the deputy FBI director under Trump, Justice Department documents show.On August 6, 2017,  The Washington Times questioned Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein s  fishing expedition  aimed at digging up dirt on President Trump in his investigation in the Trump-Russia investigation. The special counsel is subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of Justice, and we don t engage in fishing expeditions,  Mr. Rosenstein said on  Fox News Sunday. In his first Sunday show interview, Mr. Rosenstein added that special counsel Robert Mueller  understands and I understand the specific scope of the investigation and so, it s not a fishing expedition. Mr. Rosenstein s comments come amid reports citing unnamed sources that the investigation has expanded into Mr. Trump s finances unrelated to possible Russian interference in last year s election.Mr. Rosenstein played down the reports:  That s not anything that I ve said. That s not anything Director Mueller has said. We don t know who s saying it or how credible those sources are. Both men now play a key role in the current investigation into possible, but still unproven collusion between Russia and Donald Trump s campaign during the 2016 election.McCabe is under congressional and Justice Department inspector general investigation in connection with money his wife s Virginia state Senate campaign accepted in 2015 from now-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe at a time when McAuliffe was reportedly under investigation by the FBI.The connections to the current Russia case are many. The Mikerin probe began in 2009 when Robert Mueller, now the special counsel in charge of the Trump case, was still FBI director. And it ended in late 2015 under the direction of then-FBI Director James Comey, who Trump fired earlier this year.Bringing down a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme that had both compromised a sensitive uranium transportation asset inside the U.S. and facilitated international money laundering would seem a major feather in any law enforcement agency s cap.But the Justice Department and FBI took little credit in 2014 when Mikerin, the Russian financier and the trucking firm executives were arrested and charged.The only public statement occurred an entire year later when the Justice Department put out a little-noticed press release in August 2015, just days before Labor Day. The release noted that the various defendants had reached plea deals.The lack of fanfare left many key players in Washington with no inkling that a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme with serious national security implications had been uncovered.On Dec. 15, 2015, the Justice Department put out a release stating that Mikerin,  a former Russian official residing in Maryland was sentenced today to 48 months in prison  and ordered to forfeit more than $2.1 million.Ronald Hosko, who served as the assistant FBI director in charge of criminal cases when the investigation was underway, told The Hill he did not recall ever being briefed about Mikerin s case by the counterintelligence side of the bureau despite the criminal charges that were being lodged. I had no idea this case was being conducted,  a surprised Hosko said in an interview.Meanwhile, Julian Assange is jumping on the bandwagon, as he teases that he has a major announcement of his own that is coming soon Russian nuclear bribery investigation reveals that Russia routed millions to the Clintons https://t.co/ti7ycn7auf  Julian Assange   (@JulianAssange) October 17, 2017"
 Today Is The One-Year Anniversary Of Walter Scott’s Murder By Cop (VIDEO),"On April 4th, 2015, 50-year-old Walter Scott, a father of four, was pulled over by Officer Michael Slager in North Charleston, South Carolina. The cop reportedly stopped him for a broken brake light. The officer lied and said Scott attacked him and took his taser, but a bystander recorded the incident on a cell phone to the horrifying dismay of the country. The video clearly shows an unarmed Scott running away from the officer. Instead of pursuing Scott, the officer fires eight shots, killing Scott.The city agreed to pay Scott s family $6.5 million, and a grand jury handed down a murder indictment for Officer Michael Slager. Such settlements and indictments for police officers who shoot people are extremely rare, and Walter Scott is one of many black victims over the past few years to be killed by a white police officer, while police departments across the country fail to assume accountability for these constant occurrences. Freddie Gray, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, Tanisha Anderson, John Crawford III, Michael Brown Jr   the list goes on and on.People of color are increasingly at risk for being at the wrong place at the wrong time when it comes to excessive force used by many police departments. Instead of holding the officers and their departments accountable, the victims are often subjected to attacks and criticisms to disregard the outrage, unrest, and civil disobedience in cities like Ferguson, Missouri or Baltimore, Maryland. They don t acknowledge the pain and trauma inflicted on these communities by police departments who police in ways that render unarmed people being shot to death. The officer is currently out on bail of $500,000 awaiting trial later this year. This is a travesty, as given the nature of the crime, no bail should have been granted. Non-violent criminals have received stricter bail bonds. Slager also tried to sue the Southern States Police Benevolent Association for not helping him with his defense.Hopefully, there is a murder conviction in this man s future.Featured image via Flickr"
"Without Evidence, Trump Launches 59 Cruise Missiles, Destroying Syrian Air Force Base"," Last night President Donald Trump caved into the Pentagon, the political left, the Neoconservative pro-war lobby and mainstream media pressure to act after the release of YouTube videos produced by the US and UK-funded NGO the White Helmets   of an alleged  chemical weapons  attack by the Syrian Airforce in the al Qaeda stronghold of Idlib in Syria. Following the US missile strike, Al Qaeda leaders in Syria have hailed the move by Trump, expressing their gratitude for the US President s knee-jerk military action.Al Qaeda and ISIS supporters Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey have also expressed thanks to Trump for helping to degrade the Syrian military who have been fighting and winning against al Qaeda in Syria, ISIS and a host of other Gulf-sponsored terrorist groups operating in Syria.Salafist Jihadist group Ahrar al-Sham welcoming the strikes. Thanks America. pic.twitter.com/4PQzv1PVjw  Ali (@Ali_Kourani) April 7, 2017Trump s strike on Syria also helped ISIS who have been losing to the Syrian Army recently in the area of Homs and Palmyra.The Guardian confirms: Tonight I ordered a targeted military strike on the airfield in Syria from where the chemical attack was launched.It is in this vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons.There can be no dispute that Syria used banned chemical weapons, violated its obligations under the chemical weapons convention, and ignored the urging of the UN security council.Years of previous attempts at changing Assad s behaviour have all failed and failed very dramatically. There was an angry response in Russia, where the Kremlin warned that the strikes would cause  significant damage to US-Russia ties .NOTE: Tillerson has now gone so far as to blame Russia for  allowing  Syria to mount this attack They would act as the guarantor that these weapons would no longer be present in Syria. Clearly Russia has failed in its responsibility to deliver on that commitment from 2013. Either Russia has been complicit or Russia has been simply incompetent in its ability to deliver on its end of that agreement.

SYRIAN MUSLIM IMMIGRANT HAIRDRESSER SLITS Female Employer’s Throat After Media Hailed Him As “Example Of Successful Integration”,"She wanted him to assimilate. She gave him a good job. She trusted him and offered the chance to prove he was willing to be a good employee. He slit her throat. There was nothing special or unique about Mohammad Hussain Rashwani, he was just another Muslim immigrant looking for a better life who had no interest in assimilating. Slitting his employer s throat is how Rashwani chose to show his gratitude for her trust in him.Mohammad Hussain Rashwani was hailed in the media as the  paramount example of successful integration  after he got a job as a hairdresser at a salon in Herzberg, Germany in late 2015.After a little over a year on the job, he decided to slit his female employer s throat.From Lausitzer Rundschau as translated by Gates of Vienna:  For me there weren t any signs that I could see Herzberg s hairdresser speaks about the knife attack by her Syrian employeeHerzberg s master hairdresser talks about what is motivating her these days since the attack by her Syrian employee two weeks ago.Should she have seen this attack against her coming? She keeps asking herself this question over and over. And she can t find an answer.  Even today, I do not know what I should think. Until that Wednesday evening, he was an endearing man. I believed up to the very last minute that something good could come of him because I appreciated his professional abilities very much,  Ilona F. says.The Herzberg woman doesn t want to talk about the attack itself; her thoughts are much more circling around  why  again and again.  Did I intervene too much? Was I too strong for him? Did we, my husband and I, organize too much for him?  These and other thoughts are constantly crossing her mind. But there weren t any signs that the Damascus-born Syrian maybe had other plans. His mother, which whom Ilona F. was in contact, had repeatedly written how grateful her son was for the chance that he received and how much he had respected the  she-boss .  He even assured my husband and me personally of this. Yet still, something had to have happened to him that made him commit this terrible bloody deed.  For me, there were no signs that something like this could happen,  the 64-year-old says, looking back. But, she admits, he had changed considerably in the past few months. Ilona F. explains:  We had invested a lot of time in him after our spectacular beginnings, and we had helped him in every way possible. We had plans. He is an outstanding hairdresser. The customers were super-happy with his work. Until the very last minute I had believed that things were going to work. Here s where the story that is all too typical of Muslim immigrants starts to take shape:Even then changes started to set in. He, a Muslim who until now did not seem in any way a devout believer, had began to talk about Allah more and more. This certainly got on her nerves for over time. He also quit visiting the hairdresser and her husband at home. Before the changes he came by almost every day. They had talked about everything, professional and private. But he had begun to neglect his study of the German language more and more.  He kept assuring me that he wanted to learn the language, but later. More and more he said later this, later that, when we talked about his future,  the businesswoman recounts.And then there were also problems in the salon. Mohammad H. came to work too late more often; he didn t take time very seriously. He became very reluctant to drive to work at Sch newalde, where his boss owned a second hair salon. And during the week the attack took place, he outright refused to go.After a disagreement in the Herzberg salon, when a customer was unhappy with the work of the Syrian hairdresser, she had given him notice that they had to talk.  I knew it couldn t go on like this. But immediately the question arose in my mind, what would become of him if I were to throw him out. After all, I still believed in him. That this by now was a fatal mistake is something the Herzberg woman is only slowly beginning to realize.  That I could have been so wrong in my judgment of another person,  she shakes her head.  Actually, I feel really sorry for him.   Information Liberation "
DETROIT SCHOOLS CHIEF Wants To Shut Down Charter Schools Ranked “Best In The State” To Focus On Public Schools Ranked “Worst Urban School District In Country”,"Liberal logic 101 The new superintendent for Detroit s public schools said he will recommend the school district no longer authorize charter schools and focus instead on improving its conventional schools, according to the Detroit Free Press. We have to get it right with traditional public schools and our focus, our energy, our resources need to be on that,  Superintendent Nikolai Vitti told the Free Press.Hechinger Report   Since 1994, there has been an extreme decline in Detroit Public Schools  enrollment: 73 percent. This has had a huge impact on the financial stability of the district and the performance of its remaining schools. However, the expansion of charter schools is just one reason for the decline in enrollment. During that same time, the overall population in the city declined by 33 percent. In addition, the district lost a considerable number of students to inter-district choice programs with neighboring school districts, which enroll more students statewide than charter schools.ForTheRecord says: Two charter schools authorized by Detroit s public schools were rated as the best in the state, according to a report card published by the Mackinac Center for Public Policy. The report card examined Michigan s middle and elementary schools and adjusted their rankings to reflect the impact of students  economic background.Detroit s Martin Luther King Jr. Education Center Academy was the top rated elementary and middle school in the state. Ross/Hill Academy was the second-best.Ironically, Detroit s public schools have been rated as the worst large urban school district in the country.

15 SURPRISING FACTS About The White House Easter Egg Roll,"The big question this year for the White House Easter Egg roll is whether White House Press Scretary will show up as the Easter Bunny. A little known fact and tradition has been that Spicer is the Easter Bunny! What a guy! Who knew that the guy who dressed in the bunny costume would one day be the 45th President s Press Secretary 15 SURPRISING FACTS ABOUT THE WHITE HOUSE EASTER EGG ROLL:While the long-established custom of rolling eggs on the historic grounds has practically become a rite of passage for those who observe Easter, this time-honored tradition has come a long way since it was officially established by President Rutherford B. Hayes in 1878. In fact, the fun in Washington on Capitol Hill almost didn t become the grandstanding institution as we now know it today.Here, we look back at the White House Easter Egg Roll s 138-year history to highlight 15 of the most surprising and memorable moments associated with the most sought-after ticket in D.C.1. According to the White House Historical Association, some historians note that it was first lady Dolley Madison who originally proposed the idea of a public egg roll around 1810. Presidents Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson s young children held their own informal egg roll for their own amusement in the 1860s.2. Taking advantage of a day off from school, more than 10,000 children were said to have gathered near the cast-iron dome of the U.S. capitol in 1876. Baskets in tow, filled with dyed Easter eggs, they set about to carry on the holiday tradition of rolling eggs down the hills to see how far they d go without breaking.3. Uh oh, here comes the fun police. The unusual sport of rolling and racing after hard-cooked eggs apparently did a lot of damage to the grounds of the Capitol. So in 1876, members of Congress approved the Turf Protection Act, signed by President Ulysses S. Grant, which prevented the Capitol s grounds from being used  as a playground.  The law was supposed to take effect in 1877, but inclement weather prevented any Easter activities from occurring that year anyway. However, the egg rollers who showed up in 1878 were turned away and forced to play elsewhere.4. President Hayes and his wife, Lucy, brought the holiday tradition back later in 1878 for the first official White House Easter Egg Roll. Every year thereafter, with a few notable exceptions, presidents have hosted the celebration on the South Lawn.5. By the late 1800s, games such as egg picking, egg ball, toss and catch, and egg croquet were added to the Easter festivities.6. The treasured tradition was cancelled due to World War I and suspended during the Second World War in 1942. When the White House underwent renovations in that same year, it was hosted by Congress and held at other locations.7. After a 12-year hiatus, President Dwight D. Eisenhower brought the egg-stravaganza back in 1953.8. In 1969, the White House Easter Bunny went hoppin  down the government trail for the first time. The bunny was actually a staffer for first lady Pat Nixon. While we know that the Easter bunny is always part of the current administration s staff, the rules forbid the bunny from revealing his or her identity, until now that is.9. Ursula Meese, wife of President Reagan s Attorney General Edwin Meese III, was quite the Peter Rabbit of her time, as she performed as the White House Bunny for six seasons. It earned her the nickname  The Meester Bunny.  And thanks to this unofficial  Twitter account, we know just who was under the fleece costume during the George W. Bush Administration as well. Today, he s traded in the long bunny ears for a suit and a podium, but there s no word yet if current Press Secretary Sean Spicer will be making a furry-tailed appearance again for this year s celebration.10. Enter the sacred spoon in 1974. Organizers were tasked with finding silverware for the first egg-rolling races, where children used spoons to push their eggs through the grass, down marked-off lanes.11. Step right up: The circus came to town in 1977. President Jimmy Carter introduced a three-ring circus and menagerie, including a 1,200-pound steer named  Big Red. 12. President Ronald Reagan, a superstar in his own right, brought a little Hollywood to the White House event in 1981. Not only did he and wife, Nancy, present Broadway show performances and the  Egg Hunt Pits,  but they also had balloons from the Macy s Thanksgiving Day Parade floating in mid-air.13. The Reagans were also the first to use wooden eggs at the Easter egg hunt, which were signed by Hollywood s elite, widely-recognized athletes, and notable politicians. Ever since, wooden eggs imprinted with the president and first lady s signatures are handed out as a small memento to children under 13 years old.14. By 2009, the Easter Egg Roll had become the hottest ticket in D.C. So much so, an online lottery for tickets was established to give children from all around the country the opportunity to attend. The lottery is held in March each year for three days only.15. Sean Spicer is the Easter Bunny!WHAT A GUY!Via: Southern Living"

 CNN Just TORPEDOED Donald Trump With Facts To PROVE He Lied About Them Again,"CNN is definitely sick and tired of Donald Trump calling them  fake news. During an interview with Erin Burnett on Friday, Bernie Sanders jokingly referred to CNN as  fake news  to mock Donald Trump. Sanders even made sure to let Burnett know that he was just joking and Burnett acknowledged that Sanders was just joking. Soon after, a technical difficulty arose as Sanders could no longer hear Burnett. CNN then went to commercial, and Burnett apologized to the audience and to Sanders for the issue and resumed the conversation.Here s the video via CNN.Well, Fox News claimed that CNN cut off Sanders in retaliation for his  fake news  joke. And then Donald Trump tweeted about it several minutes later and made the same claim.While on FAKE NEWS @CNN, Bernie Sanders was cut off for using the term fake news to describe the network. They said technical difficulties!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 12, 2017That s when CNN proceeded to strongly fire back as Brian Stelter set the record straight by linking to the full video of the interview and call Trump out for lying.Untrue. Sanders was *criticizing Trump* for calling CNN  fake news.  You can see for yourself, all 11 minutes, here: https://t.co/qhtlb5Wo6Q https://t.co/AcwOiNHi0j  Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) February 12, 2017Stop me if you ve heard this one before. But @FoxAndFriends covered the Bernie  technical difficulties  thing at 6:40. Trump tweeted at 7:14 https://t.co/AcwOiNHi0j  Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) February 12, 2017And then CNN Communications issued a transcript of the interview as further proof that Trump is lying.@realDonaldTrump False. Transcript from @ErinBurnett intvu w @SenSanders. He was not cut off. Those are the facts. https://t.co/NzJNgdYSIX pic.twitter.com/AOFKLHUlGk  CNN Communications (@CNNPR) February 12, 2017Clearly, Donald Trump once again got  alternative facts  from Fox News and repeated them as his proof that CNN is  fake news. But if he had simply taken ten minutes to watch the actual interview, he would know that Sanders was only joking, and that CNN did not cut Sanders off. It really was a technical difficulty and Sanders was able to continue the interview after the issue was fixed. But Trump didn t bother to do that, and he got his ass handed to him for it.Last week, Trump claimed that CNN host Chris Cuomo failed to ask a guest a specific question, only to get skewered by Cuomo and CNN Communications again for lying. Had Trump watched the very beginning of the interview, he wouldn t have humiliated himself.. @ChrisCuomo did address that point at the start of his interview. Those are the facts: https://t.co/JWJEAshv1y  CNN Communications (@CNNPR) February 9, 2017Donald Trump won t bother to do simple research before he runs his mouth on Twitter, and that means he probably doesn t bother to do any research before making decisions as president. That s not only scary, it s stupid.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images"
TRUMP HATER GEORGE RAMOS Promotes Movie Showing Illegal Aliens Being Shot At Border By Drunk Vigilante…Blames Trump [VIDEO],"Mexico has been the beneficiary of our open borders for decades. It s really quite amazing how loudly they cry foul when we finally have a presidential candidate willing to stand up to this insanity and say,  ENOUGH! It s Time to put Americans first! Illegal immigrants send home $50 billion annually but cost taxpayers more than $113 billion. Approximately 126,000 illegal immigrants emigrated from these three nations to the U.S. since last October and federal officials estimate at least 95,500 more will enter next year.The Central American governments have encouraged the high levels of emigration because it is earning their economy billions of dollars! For every illegal alien that sneaks into the U.S. and remits money back home, that grand total remittance number only grows. But what if the millions of U.S. jobs now filled by illegal aliens were done by American workers earning better wages, paying more in taxes and spending their money in their communities rather than sending it abroad?Americans are the ones forced to pick up the $113 billion tab for taking care of the country s 12 million illegal immigrants. Is it the responsibility of taxpaying citizens to cover the cost of illegal immigration and the government s aid to these countries while illegal workers continue to send their money overseas to send $50 billion overseas? Via: immigrationreform.comYet, somehow Donald Trump is to BLAME for wanting to shut down our open borders and bring some sanity back to our nation that is being overrun by Mexican drug runners and gang bangers coming from every corner of Mexico, Central and South America? A new Mexican movie promoted by Univision host Jorge Ramos portrays a drunk vigilante motivated by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump s anti-immigrant rant killing at least four illegal immigrants at the border.The trailer for the movie, Desierto, now in Mexican theaters, blasts out Trump s initial criticism of illegal immigrants as a man armed with a rifle guns down targets crossing under barbed wire.https://youtu.be/V48ttgGqsswIt later shows the same man, in a pickup holding a bottle of what appears to be whisky, a beer can nearby, as a voice says,  Welcome to the land of the free.  The trailer ends with,  words are as dangerous as bullets. The Center for Immigration Studies on Tuesday first blogged on the  exploitation  movie and the promotion by Ramos on his Sunday show Al Punto. This material resonates powerfully with Jorge Ramos. His conviction that racism and xenophobia are the driving forces of opposition to illegal immigration is a central theme of his nightly newscasts. Ramos fixates on reports that confirm his conviction with the obsessiveness of an exploitation film director showing close-ups of bullets tearing into human flesh,  wrote CIS Fellow Jerry Kammer.He added:  On Sunday, Ramos talked with  Desierto  director Jonas Cuaron and star Gael Garcia Bernal about Trump s repugnant comments about Mexicans. Since then, Ramos said,  there are thousands if not millions of North Americans who feel that they have the absolute freedom to be racists. Via: Washington Examiner"
 Louis C.K. Tears ‘Insane Bigot’ Donald Trump Apart In Devastating Rant: ‘The Guy Is Hitler’ (IMAGE),"Add comedian Louis C.K. to the ever-growing lost of people trying to stop Republican front-runner Donald Trump from getting any closer to the White House. In a scathing rant released on Saturday morning, C.K. skewered Trump with a plea to voters in an email about his web series  Horace and Pete. C.K. compared Trump to Adolf Hitler, stating that the Nazi leader was once thought to be just a harmless crazy nut   until it was too late to stop him. C.K. s message, which appeared in full on Variety, said: Please stop it with voting for Trump. It was funny for a little while. But the guy is Hitler. And by that I mean that we are being Germany in the  30s. Do you think they saw the s t coming? Hitler was just some hilarious and refreshing dude with a weird comb over who would say anything at all. Twitter He s not a monster. He s a sad man. But all this makes him horribly dangerous if he becomes president. Give him another TV show. Let him pay to put his name on buildings. But please stop voting for him. C.K. didn t mince his words as he continued, stating that voting for Trump would be  national suicide. I get that all these people sound like bullshit soft criminal opportunists. The whole game feels rigged and it s not going anywhere but down anymore. I feel that way sometimes. And that voting for Trump is a way of saying  f*ck it. F*ck them all . I really get it. It s a version of national Suicide. Or it s like a big hit off of a crack pipe. Somehow we can t help it. Or we know that if we vote for Trump our phones will be a reliable source of dopamine for the next four years. I mean I can t wait to read about Trump every day. It s a rush. But you have to know this is not healthy. C.K. noted that although he likes the Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, he would enjoy seeing the next president as a conservative. However, he s smart enough to recognize that Trump is not the guy to face Sanders or Clinton, and certainly not presidential material: I m not advocating for Hillary or Bernie. I like them both but frankly I wish the next president was a conservative only because we had Obama for eight years and we need balance. And not because I particularly enjoy the conservative agenda. I just think the government should reflect the people. And we are about 40 percent conservative and 40 percent liberal. When I was growing up and when I was a younger man, liberals and conservatives were friends with differences. They weren t enemies. And it always made sense that everyone gets a president they like for a while and then hates the president for a while. But it only works if the conservatives put up a good candidate. A good smart conservative to face the liberal candidate so they can have a good argument and the country can decide which way to go this time. Trump is not that. He s an insane bigot. He is dangerous. For all the conservatives that have pledged to vote for Trump despite how awful they acknowledge him to be, C.K. had some much-needed advice: If you are a true conservative. Don t vote for Trump. He is not one of you. He is one of him. Everything you have heard him say that you liked, if you look hard enough you will see that he one day said the exact opposite. He is playing you. Trump is not your best. He s the worst of all of us. He s a symptom to a problem that is very real. But don t vote for your own cancer. You re better than that. C.K. is just the latest comedian to blast Trump, and his message follows an epic verbal lashing from John Oliver on Last Week Tonight, which aired a 20-minute takedown of Trump. Many other celebrities, including Miley Cyrus, George Clooney, and Stephen King, have also urged voters to wise up and forget about voting for the business mogul.Currently, the Republican party is scrambling to figure out what to do with Trump. He s currently dominating the GOP polls, and even though several conservatives have pledged to stop him, many Republicans feel helpless and are afraid no other candidate will be able to stop him from getting the nomination.Featured image via Wikimedia Commons and Gage Skidmore"
PANERA BREAD CEO 2014: “Don’t Bring Your Guns Into Restaurants”…UPDATE: Two MD Sheriffs Shot And KILLED In Panera Bread Restaurant,"Only two days ago, Beyonce used her Super Bowl halftime show to glorify hating cops in front of millions of Americans. Two years ago, CEO s of major companies agreed to ban guns in states where citizens are allowed to carry guns. How long will America sit back and allow the Left to dictate the terms by which we live? Our safety and security is slipping away and we don t appear to have too many people in DC standing up for our rights. Meanwhile, the media seems to be perplexed over the rise of Donald Trump and Ted Cruz in the polls go figure FLASHBACK:Sept. 2014: Bakery-cafe chain Panera Bread has joined a growing list of retailers including Starbucks and Target by announcing that customers should leave their guns at home.The 1,800-outlet, $4.2 billion (market cap) company issued a brief statement on Monday after CEO Ron Shaich spoke to CNBC about the decision:Within our company, we strive to create Panera Warmth. This warmth means bakery-cafes where customers and associates feel comfortable and welcome. To this end, we ask that guns not be brought into this environment unless carried by an authorized law enforcement officer. Panera respects the rights of gun owners, but asks our customers to help preserve the environment we are working to create for our guests and associates.In the weeks and months leading up to this policy announcement, Panera Bread sought advice from Michael Bloomberg-backed Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, now part of the former Mayor s $50 million Everytown nonprofit. Panera deserves our thanks and our congratulations for taking this important step, and I applaud the company for proactively consulting Moms Demand Action as it developed and implemented its policy,  said the group s founder Shannon Watts, who has herself become the focus of ire from open carry activists and the NRA in recent months following efforts to see retailers and restaurant chains change their firearms policies.Watts and her team have most recently spent six figures on an ad blitz aiming to force the hand of Kroger, the country s largest grocery store chain. As of press time, Kroger maintained it would respect state and local laws on gun rights. Via: Forbes February 10, 2016:ABINGDON, Md.  Two Harford County Sheriff s deputies have succumbed to their injuries after shootings at an Abingdon shopping center, officials said.Authorities said a deputy responded to a disturbance call at 11:46 a.m. Wednesday at the Panera Bread near Emmorton Road in Abingdon. That deputy was wounded when at least one shot was fired in his direction, Harford County Sheriff Jeffrey Gahler said. Gahler said restaurant witnesses gave good information as to which way the shooter went. A second responding deputy found the suspect, and shots were fired again, injuring the second deputy. We believe the deputies were shot by the same suspect,  Gahler said. (The shooter) just took out his gun and shot him in the head right after the officer asked him,  How s your day?  witness Sophia Faulkner said.Two additional deputies, who responded to the initial shooting, fired rounds, and a short time later, the suspect was killed, Gahler said. The suspect was identified as 67-year-old David Evans, Gahler said. We know that there were two warrants for his arrest,  Gahler said.  We believe we were sent (to Panera Bread), because someone knew who he was. Police said Evans had two open warrants in two states. Evans had a criminal warrant in Florida for assaulting a police officer and fleeing and eluding police. In Harford County, Evans had an open civil warrant.A loaded handgun was found with Evans after the shootout, Gahler said. We are not looking for anyone else,  Gahler said.  There is no longer a threat to the community. The two deputies involved in shooting the suspect were placed on administrative leave, per agency protocol pending a completed investigation, Gahler said.SkyTeam 11 Capt. Roy Taylor reported that at least one deputy was airlifted to Shock Trauma. The other deputy was taken to University of Maryland Upper Chesapeake Medical Center in Bel Air. During a news conference Wednesday evening, Gahler said both deputies succumbed to their injuries. Today s a sad day for the Harford County Sheriff s Office and the citizens of Harford County, who we are sworn to serve. It s with great sadness that I tell you both deputies who were shot earlier today have succumbed to their injuries. One of our deputies was a 30-year veteran of this agency, served in the Court Services Division. The other deputy had served this agency for the last 16 years and was assigned to the Community Services Division. I would ask you at this time to please respect the families  privacy as they go through the period of grieving. I ve met with both families. I still have to go to Upper Chesapeake. Obviously, I don t think I have to tell anybody. There s no words to describe what they are going through right now,  Gahler said. Anytime law enforcement or first responders lose their lives in the line of duty, it is a tragedy and today s violence in Abingdon and the deaths of two Harford County sheriff s deputies is nothing less than absolutely heartbreaking,  Gov. Larry Hogan said. "

 Spicer: It Would Be ‘Misguided And Wrong’ To NOT Handcuff 5-Year-Old Muslim Children (VIDEO),"There was a time when a brutal dictator would strip children from their parents, handcuffing and detaining them simply because of their religion. It was a shameful time in our world s history that we must be careful not to repea oh, this happened over the f*cking weekend?If you haven t seen it yet, one incident stemming from the chaos caused by Trump s Muslim ban perfectly demonstrates how far we have fallen. On Saturday, a 5-year-old U.S. citizen was stripped from his family thanks to President Asterisk s Muslim ban. The Maryland boy was traveling to Washington Dulles airport with another family member to meet his mother, who is from Iran, when they were stopped and the child was handcuffed and detained for hours. The Huffington Post reports:A 5-year-old boy who was swept up in President Donald Trump s executive order was reunited with his mother Saturday after enduring a several-hour detention, emotional video shows.The little boy, who U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) identified as a U.S. citizen and Maryland resident, was seen being showered with kisses as his mother embraced him at Washington D.C. s Dulles International Airport, WJZ-TV reported.The child s mother, who is reportedly from Iran, declined an interview as she rushed out of the airport. Family surrounding the mother and son meanwhile clutched balloons and sang  Happy Birthday  to the boy, who had been flying with another family member.But not to worry. On Monday, White House press secretary assured us that this would never happen again   just kidding, he doubled down on the decision to treat a 5-year-old U.S. citizen like a terrorist. To assume someone because of their age or gender, that they don t pose a threat, would be misguided and wrong,  Spicer said during a press conference when asked about the situation.If you thought there would be any repentance over the disaster that was this past weekend, you were also  misguided and wrong.  The United States has entered a terrifying time in its history, one we can only survive if we stick together and continue to stand up for the oppressed   including those who are too small to be heard on their own.Fuck you, Spicer.

What is The Deep State?,"One of the ancillary benefits of Donald Trump s insurgence into the US political scene has been a forceful injection of realism into the national political discourse. One of those points of discussion is centered around the concept of a  state within a state,  commonly referred to as the Deep State. It s suddenly become an acceptable mainstream idea, but prior to the 2016 election cycle, that conversation was strictly a fringe affair, mostly relegated to the realms of  conspiracy  forums and alternative media. but now it s written and spoken about as a mainstream talking point. One of the most coherent articulations of this idea originated from a former US Congressional staffer turned best-selling author, Mike Lofgren. In his book, The Deep State, he outlines the shape and structure of this seemingly invisible  state within a state,  but unlike the establishment media s innocuous commentary, Lofgren also delivers a incisive moral verdict on this power transition and explains how it s not only eviscerating the fabric of democracy and the foundations of the Constitutional Republic, but more importantly how it s destroying society.More than ever, it s important to understand just how we arrived at this crucial point in history and more importantly   what can be done to derail this silent coup in the United States, and internationally too.The following essay was written by Lofgren in 2014, and still stands firm as a critical deconstruction of the current shadow state set-up in America . Rome lived upon its principal till ruin stared it in the face. Industry is the only true source of wealth, and there was no industry in Rome. By day the Ostia road was crowded with carts and muleteers, carrying to the great city the silks and spices of the East, the marble of Asia Minor, the timber of the Atlas, the grain of Africa and Egypt; and the carts brought out nothing but loads of dung. That was their return cargo.  The Martyrdom of Man, by Winwood Reade (1871) . By Mike LofgrenThere is the visible government situated around the Mall in Washington, and then there is another, more shadowy, more indefinable government that is not explained in Civics 101 or observable to tourists at the White House or the Capitol. The former is traditional Washington partisan politics: the tip of the iceberg that a public watching C-SPAN sees daily and which is theoretically controllable via elections. The subsurface part of the iceberg I shall call the Deep State, which operates according to its own compass heading regardless of who is formally in power. [1]During the last five years, the news media have been flooded with pundits decrying the broken politics of Washington. The conventional wisdom has it that partisan gridlock and dysfunction have become the new normal. That is certainly the case, and I have been among the harshest critics of this development. But it is also imperative to acknowledge the limits of this critique as it applies to the American governmental system. On one level, the critique is self-evident: In the domain that the public can see, Congress is hopelessly deadlocked in the worst manner since the 1850s, the violently rancorous decade preceding the Civil War.Yes, there is another government concealed behind the one that is visible at either end of Pennsylvania Avenue, a hybrid entity of public and private institutions ruling the country As I wrote in The Party is Over, the present objective of congressional Republicans is to render the executive branch powerless, at least until a Republican president is elected (a goal that voter suppression laws in GOP-controlled states are clearly intended to accomplish). President Obama cannot enact his domestic policies and budgets: Because of incessant GOP filibustering, not only could he not fill the large number of vacancies in the federal judiciary, he could not even get his most innocuous presidential appointees into office. Democrats controlling the Senate have responded by weakening the filibuster of nominations, but Republicans are sure to react with other parliamentary delaying tactics. This strategy amounts to congressional nullification of executive branch powers by a party that controls a majority in only one house of Congress. Despite this apparent impotence, President Obama can liquidate American citizens without due processes, detain prisoners indefinitely without charge, conduct dragnet surveillance on the American people without judicial warrant and engage in unprecedented   at least since the McCarthy era   witch hunts against federal employees (the so-called  Insider Threat Program ). Within the United States, this power is characterized by massive displays of intimidating force by militarized federal, state and local law enforcement. Abroad, President Obama can start wars at will and engage in virtually any other activity whatsoever without so much as a by-your-leave from Congress, such as arranging the forced landing of a plane carrying a sovereign head of state over foreign territory. Despite the habitual cant of congressional Republicans about executive overreach by Obama, the would-be dictator, we have until recently heard very little from them about these actions   with the minor exception of comments from gadfly Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky. Democrats, save a few mavericks such as Ron Wyden of Oregon, are not unduly troubled, either   even to the extent of permitting seemingly perjured congressional testimony under oath by executive branch officials on the subject of illegal surveillance.These are not isolated instances of a contradiction; they have been so pervasive that they tend to be disregarded as background noise. During the time in 2011 when political warfare over the debt ceiling was beginning to paralyze the business of governance in Washington, the United States government somehow summoned the resources to overthrow Muammar Ghaddafi s regime in Libya, and, when the instability created by that coup spilled over into Mali, provide overt and covert assistance to French intervention there. At a time when there was heated debate about continuing meat inspections and civilian air traffic control because of the budget crisis, our government was somehow able to commit $115 million to keeping a civil war going in Syria and to pay at least  100m to the United Kingdom s Government Communications Headquarters to buy influence over and access to that country s intelligence. Since 2007, two bridges carrying interstate highways have collapsed due to inadequate maintenance of infrastructure, one killing 13 people. During that same period of time, the government spent $1.7 billion constructing a building in Utah that is the size of 17 football fields. This mammoth structure is intended to allow the National Security Agency to store a yottabyte of information, the largest numerical designator computer scientists have coined. A yottabyte is equal to 500 quintillion pages of text. They need that much storage to archive every single trace of your electronic life.Yes, there is another government concealed behind the one that is visible at either end of Pennsylvania Avenue, a hybrid entity of public and private institutions ruling the country according to consistent patterns in season and out, connected to, but only intermittently controlled by, the visible state whose leaders we choose. My analysis of this phenomenon is not an expos  of a secret, conspiratorial cabal; the state within a state is hiding mostly in plain sight, and its operators mainly act in the light of day. Nor can this other government be accurately termed an  establishment.  All complex societies have an establishment, a social network committed to its own enrichment and perpetuation. In terms of its scope, financial resources and sheer global reach, the American hybrid state, the Deep State, is in a class by itself. That said, it is neither omniscient nor invincible. The institution is not so much sinister (although it has highly sinister aspects) as it is relentlessly well entrenched. Far from being invincible, its failures, such as those in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya, are routine enough that it is only the Deep State s protectiveness towards its higher-ranking personnel that allows them to escape the consequences of their frequent ineptitude. [2]How did I come to write an analysis of the Deep State, and why am I equipped to write it? As a congressional staff member for 28 years specializing in national security and possessing a top secret security clearance, I was at least on the fringes of the world I am describing, if neither totally in it by virtue of full membership nor of it by psychological disposition. But, like virtually every employed person, I became, to some extent, assimilated into the culture of the institution I worked for, and only by slow degrees, starting before the invasion of Iraq, did I begin fundamentally to question the reasons of state that motivate the people who are, to quote George W. Bush,  the deciders. Cultural assimilation is partly a matter of what psychologist Irving L. Janis called  groupthink,  the chameleon-like ability of people to adopt the views of their superiors and peers. This syndrome is endemic to Washington: The town is characterized by sudden fads, be it negotiating biennial budgeting, making grand bargains or invading countries. Then, after a while, all the town s cool kids drop those ideas as if they were radioactive. As in the military, everybody has to get on board with the mission, and questioning it is not a career-enhancing move. The universe of people who will critically examine the goings-on at the institutions they work for is always going to be a small one. As Upton Sinclair said,  It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it. A more elusive aspect of cultural assimilation is the sheer dead weight of the ordinariness of it all once you have planted yourself in your office chair for the 10,000th time. Government life is typically not some vignette from an Allen Drury novel about intrigue under the Capitol dome. Sitting and staring at the clock on the off-white office wall when it s 11:00 in the evening and you are vowing never, ever to eat another piece of takeout pizza in your life is not an experience that summons the higher literary instincts of a would-be memoirist. After a while, a functionary of the state begins to hear things that, in another context, would be quite remarkable, or at least noteworthy, and yet that simply bounce off one s consciousness like pebbles off steel plate:  You mean the number of terrorist groups we are fighting is classified?  No wonder so few people are whistle-blowers, quite apart from the vicious retaliation whistle-blowing often provokes: Unless one is blessed with imagination and a fine sense of irony, growing immune to the curiousness of one s surroundings is easy. To paraphrase the inimitable Donald Rumsfeld, I didn t know all that I knew, at least until I had had a couple of years away from the government to reflect upon it.The Deep State does not consist of the entire government. It is a hybrid of national security and law enforcement agencies: the Department of Defense, the Department of State, the Department of Homeland Security, the Central Intelligence Agency and the Justice Department. I also include the Department of the Treasury because of its jurisdiction over financial flows, its enforcement of international sanctions and its organic symbiosis with Wall Street. All these agencies are coordinated by the Executive Office of the President via the National Security Council. Certain key areas of the judiciary belong to the Deep State, such as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, whose actions are mysterious even to most members of Congress. Also included are a handful of vital federal trial courts, such as the Eastern District of Virginia and the Southern District of Manhattan, where sensitive proceedings in national security cases are conducted. The final government component (and possibly last in precedence among the formal branches of government established by the Constitution) is a kind of rump Congress consisting of the congressional leadership and some (but not all) of the members of the defense and intelligence committees. The rest of Congress, normally so fractious and partisan, is mostly only intermittently aware of the Deep State and when required usually submits to a few well-chosen words from the State s emissaries.I saw this submissiveness on many occasions. One memorable incident was passage of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Amendments Act of 2008. This legislation retroactively legalized the Bush administration s illegal and unconstitutional surveillance first revealed by The New York Times in 2005 and indemnified the telecommunications companies for their cooperation in these acts. The bill passed easily: All that was required was the invocation of the word  terrorism  and most members of Congress responded like iron filings obeying a magnet. One who responded in that fashion was Senator Barack Obama, soon to be coronated as the presidential nominee at the Democratic National Convention in Denver. He had already won the most delegates by campaigning to the left of his main opponent, Hillary Clinton, on the excesses of the global war on terror and the erosion of constitutional liberties.As the indemnification vote showed, the Deep State does not consist only of government agencies. What is euphemistically called  private enterprise  is an integral part of its operations. In a special series in The Washington Post called  Top Secret America,  Dana Priest and William K. Arkin described the scope of the privatized Deep State and the degree to which it has metastasized after the September 11 attacks. There are now 854,000 contract personnel with top-secret clearances   a number greater than that of top-secret-cleared civilian employees of the government. While they work throughout the country and the world, their heavy concentration in and around the Washington suburbs is unmistakable: Since 9/11, 33 facilities for top-secret intelligence have been built or are under construction. Combined, they occupy the floor space of almost three Pentagons   about 17 million square feet. Seventy percent of the intelligence community s budget goes to paying contracts. And the membrane between government and industry is highly permeable: The Director of National Intelligence, James R. Clapper, is a former executive of Booz Allen Hamilton, one of the government s largest intelligence contractors. His predecessor as director, Admiral Mike McConnell, is the current vice chairman of the same company; Booz Allen is 99 percent dependent on government business. These contractors now set the political and social tone of Washington, just as they are increasingly setting the direction of the country, but they are doing it quietly, their doings unrecorded in the Congressional Record or the Federal Register, and are rarely subject to congressional hearings.Washington is the most important node of the Deep State that has taken over America, but it is not the only one. Invisible threads of money and ambition connect the town to other nodes. One is Wall Street, which supplies the cash that keeps the political machine quiescent and operating as a diversionary marionette theater. Should the politicians forget their lines and threaten the status quo, Wall Street floods the town with cash and lawyers to help the hired hands remember their own best interests. The executives of the financial giants even have de facto criminal immunity. On March 6, 2013, testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Attorney General Eric Holder stated the following:  I am concerned that the size of some of these institutions becomes so large that it does become difficult for us to prosecute them when we are hit with indications that if you do prosecute, if you do bring a criminal charge, it will have a negative impact on the national economy, perhaps even the world economy.  This, from the chief law enforcement officer of a justice system that has practically abolished the constitutional right to trial for poorer defendants charged with certain crimes. It is not too much to say that Wall Street may be the ultimate owner of the Deep State and its strategies, if for no other reason than that it has the money to reward government operatives with a second career that is lucrative beyond the dreams of avarice   certainly beyond the dreams of a salaried government employee. [3]The corridor between Manhattan and Washington is a well trodden highway for the personalities we have all gotten to know in the period since the massive deregulation of Wall Street: Robert Rubin, Lawrence Summers, Henry Paulson, Timothy Geithner and many others. Not all the traffic involves persons connected with the purely financial operations of the government: In 2013, General David Petraeus joined KKR (formerly Kohlberg Kravis Roberts) of 9 West 57th Street, New York, a private equity firm with $62.3 billion in assets. KKR specializes in management buyouts and leveraged finance. General Petraeus  expertise in these areas is unclear. His ability to peddle influence, however, is a known and valued commodity. Unlike Cincinnatus, the military commanders of the Deep State do not take up the plow once they lay down the sword. Petraeus also obtained a sinecure as a non-resident senior fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard. The Ivy League is, of course, the preferred bleaching tub and charm school of the American oligarchy. [4]Petraeus and most of the avatars of the Deep State   the White House advisers who urged Obama not to impose compensation limits on Wall Street CEOs, the contractor-connected think tank experts who besought us to  stay the course  in Iraq, the economic gurus who perpetually demonstrate that globalization and deregulation are a blessing that makes us all better off in the long run   are careful to pretend that they have no ideology. Their preferred pose is that of the politically neutral technocrat offering well considered advice based on profound expertise. That is nonsense. They are deeply dyed in the hue of the official ideology of the governing class, an ideology that is neither specifically Democrat nor Republican. Domestically, whatever they might privately believe about essentially diversionary social issues such as abortion or gay marriage, they almost invariably believe in the  Washington Consensus : financialization, outsourcing, privatization, deregulation and the commodifying of labor. Internationally, they espouse 21st-century  American Exceptionalism : the right and duty of the United States to meddle in every region of the world with coercive diplomacy and boots on the ground and to ignore painfully won international norms of civilized behavior. To paraphrase what Sir John Harrington said more than 400 years ago about treason, now that the ideology of the Deep State has prospered, none dare call it ideology. [5] That is why describing torture with the word  torture  on broadcast television is treated less as political heresy than as an inexcusable lapse of Washington etiquette: Like smoking a cigarette on camera, these days it is simply  not done. After Edward Snowden s revelations about the extent and depth of surveillance by the National Security Agency, it has become publicly evident that Silicon Valley is a vital node of the Deep State as well. Unlike military and intelligence contractors, Silicon Valley overwhelmingly sells to the private market, but its business is so important to the government that a strange relationship has emerged. While the government could simply dragoon the high technology companies to do the NSA s bidding, it would prefer cooperation with so important an engine of the nation s economy, perhaps with an implied quid pro quo. Perhaps this explains the extraordinary indulgence the government shows the Valley in intellectual property matters. If an American  jailbreaks  his smartphone (i.e., modifies it so that it can use a service provider other than the one dictated by the manufacturer), he could receive a fine of up to $500,000 and several years in prison; so much for a citizen s vaunted property rights to what he purchases. The libertarian pose of the Silicon Valley moguls, so carefully cultivated in their public relations, has always been a sham. Silicon Valley has long been tracking for commercial purposes the activities of every person who uses an electronic device, so it is hardly surprising that the Deep State should emulate the Valley and do the same for its own purposes. Nor is it surprising that it should conscript the Valley s assistance.Still, despite the essential roles of lower Manhattan and Silicon Valley, the center of gravity of the Deep State is firmly situated in and around the Beltway. The Deep State s physical expansion and consolidation around the Beltway would seem to make a mockery of the frequent pronouncement that governance in Washington is dysfunctional and broken. That the secret and unaccountable Deep State floats freely above the gridlock between both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue is the paradox of American government in the 21st century: drone strikes, data mining, secret prisons and Panopticon-like control on the one hand; and on the other, the ordinary, visible parliamentary institutions of self-government declining to the status of a banana republic amid the gradual collapse of public infrastructure.The results of this contradiction are not abstract, as a tour of the rotting, decaying, bankrupt cities of the American Midwest will attest. It is not even confined to those parts of the country left behind by a Washington Consensus that decreed the financialization and deindustrialization of the economy in the interests of efficiency and shareholder value. This paradox is evident even within the Beltway itself, the richest metropolitan area in the nation. Although demographers and urban researchers invariably count Washington as a  world city,  that is not always evident to those who live there. Virtually every time there is a severe summer thunderstorm, tens   or even hundreds   of thousands of residents lose power, often for many days. There are occasional water restrictions over wide areas because water mains, poorly constructed and inadequately maintained, have burst. [6] The Washington metropolitan area considers it a Herculean task just to build a rail link to its international airport   with luck it may be completed by 2018.It is as if Hadrian s Wall was still fully manned and the fortifications along the border with Germania were never stronger, even as the city of Rome disintegrates from within and the life-sustaining aqueducts leading down from the hills begin to crumble. The governing classes of the Deep State may continue to deceive themselves with their dreams of Zeus-like omnipotence, but others do not. A 2013 Pew Poll that interviewed 38,000 people around the world found that in 23 of 39 countries surveyed, a plurality of respondents said they believed China already had or would in the future replace the United States as the world s top economic power.The Deep State is the big story of our time. It is the red thread that runs through the war on terrorism, the financialization and deindustrialization of the American economy, the rise of a plutocratic social structure and political dysfunction. Washington is the headquarters of the Deep State, and its time in the sun as a rival to Rome, Constantinople or London may be term-limited by its overweening sense of self-importance and its habit, as Winwood Reade said of Rome, to  live upon its principal till ruin stared it in the face.   Living upon its principal,  in this case, means that the Deep State has been extracting value from the American people in vampire-like fashion.We are faced with two disagreeable implications. First, that the Deep State is so heavily entrenched, so well protected by surveillance, firepower, money and its ability to co-opt resistance that it is almost impervious to change. Second, that just as in so many previous empires, the Deep State is populated with those whose instinctive reaction to the failure of their policies is to double down on those very policies in the future. Iraq was a failure briefly camouflaged by the wholly propagandistic success of the so-called surge; this legerdemain allowed for the surge in Afghanistan, which equally came to naught. Undeterred by that failure, the functionaries of the Deep State plunged into Libya; the smoking rubble of the Benghazi consulate, rather than discouraging further misadventure, seemed merely to incite the itch to bomb Syria. Will the Deep State ride on the back of the American people from failure to failure until the country itself, despite its huge reserves of human and material capital, is slowly exhausted? The dusty road of empire is strewn with the bones of former great powers that exhausted themselves in like manner.But, there are signs of resistance to the Deep State and its demands. In the aftermath of the Snowden revelations, the House narrowly failed to pass an amendment that would have defunded the NSA s warrantless collection of data from US persons. Shortly thereafter, the president, advocating yet another military intervention in the Middle East, this time in Syria, met with such overwhelming congressional skepticism that he changed the subject by grasping at a diplomatic lifeline thrown to him by Vladimir Putin. [7]Has the visible, constitutional state, the one envisaged by Madison and the other Founders, finally begun to reassert itself against the claims and usurpations of the Deep State? To some extent, perhaps. The unfolding revelations of the scope of the NSA s warrantless surveillance have become so egregious that even institutional apologists such as Senator Dianne Feinstein have begun to backpedal   if only rhetorically   from their knee-jerk defense of the agency. As more people begin to waken from the fearful and suggestible state that 9/11 created in their minds, it is possible that the Deep State s decade-old tactic of crying  terrorism!  every time it faces resistance is no longer eliciting the same Pavlovian response of meek obedience. And the American people, possibly even their legislators, are growing tired of endless quagmires in the Middle East.But there is another more structural reason the Deep State may have peaked in the extent of its dominance. While it seems to float above the constitutional state, its essentially parasitic, extractive nature means that it is still tethered to the formal proceedings of governance. The Deep State thrives when there is tolerable functionality in the day-to-day operations of the federal government. As long as appropriations bills get passed on time, promotion lists get confirmed, black (i.e., secret) budgets get rubber-stamped, special tax subsidies for certain corporations are approved without controversy, as long as too many awkward questions are not asked, the gears of the hybrid state will mesh noiselessly. But when one house of Congress is taken over by tea party Wahhabites, life for the ruling class becomes more trying.If there is anything the Deep State requires it is silent, uninterrupted cash flow and the confidence that things will go on as they have in the past. It is even willing to tolerate a degree of gridlock: Partisan mud wrestling over cultural issues may be a useful distraction from its agenda. But recent congressional antics involving sequestration, the government shutdown and the threat of default over the debt ceiling extension have been disrupting that equilibrium. And an extreme gridlock dynamic has developed between the two parties such that continuing some level of sequestration is politically the least bad option for both parties, albeit for different reasons. As much as many Republicans might want to give budget relief to the organs of national security, they cannot fully reverse sequestration without the Democrats demanding revenue increases. And Democrats wanting to spend more on domestic discretionary programs cannot void sequestration on either domestic or defense programs without Republicans insisting on entitlement cuts.So, for the foreseeable future, the Deep State must restrain its appetite for taxpayer dollars. Limited deals may soften sequestration, but agency requests will not likely be fully funded anytime soon. Even Wall Street s rentier operations have been affected: After helping finance the tea party to advance its own plutocratic ambitions, America s Big Money is now regretting the Frankenstein s monster it has created. Like children playing with dynamite, the tea party and its compulsion to drive the nation into credit default has alarmed the grown-ups commanding the heights of capital; the latter are now telling the politicians they thought they had hired to knock it off.The House vote to defund the NSA s illegal surveillance programs was equally illustrative of the disruptive nature of the tea party insurgency. Civil liberties Democrats alone would never have come so close to victory; tea party stalwart Justin Amash (R-MI), who has also upset the business community for his debt-limit fundamentalism, was the lead Republican sponsor of the NSA amendment, and most of the Republicans who voted with him were aligned with the tea party.The final factor is Silicon Valley. Owing to secrecy and obfuscation, it is hard to know how much of the NSA s relationship with the Valley is based on voluntary cooperation, how much is legal compulsion through FISA warrants and how much is a matter of the NSA surreptitiously breaking into technology companies  systems. Given the Valley s public relations requirement to mollify its customers who have privacy concerns, it is difficult to take the tech firms  libertarian protestations about government compromise of their systems at face value, especially since they engage in similar activity against their own customers for commercial purposes. That said, evidence is accumulating that Silicon Valley is losing billions in overseas business from companies, individuals and governments that want to maintain privacy. For high tech entrepreneurs, the cash nexus is ultimately more compelling than the Deep State s demand for patriotic cooperation. Even legal compulsion can be combatted: Unlike the individual citizen, tech firms have deep pockets and batteries of lawyers with which to fight government diktat.This pushback has gone so far that on January 17, President Obama announced revisions to the NSA s data collection programs, including withdrawing the agency s custody of a domestic telephone record database, expanding requirements for judicial warrants and ceasing to spy on (undefined)  friendly foreign leaders.  Critics have denounced the changes as a cosmetic public relations move, but they are still significant in that the clamor has gotten so loud that the president feels the political need to address it.When the contradictions within a ruling ideology are pushed too far, factionalism appears and that ideology begins slowly to crumble. Corporate oligarchs such as the Koch brothers are no longer entirely happy with the faux-populist political front group they helped fund and groom. Silicon Valley, for all the Ayn Rand-like tendencies of its major players, its offshoring strategies and its further exacerbation of income inequality, is now lobbying Congress to restrain the NSA, a core component of the Deep State. Some tech firms are moving to encrypt their data. High tech corporations and governments alike seek dominance over people though collection of personal data, but the corporations are jumping ship now that adverse public reaction to the NSA scandals threatens their profits.The outcome of all these developments is uncertain. The Deep State, based on the twin pillars of national security imperative and corporate hegemony, has until recently seemed unshakable and the latest events may only be a temporary perturbation in its trajectory. But history has a way of toppling the altars of the mighty. While the two great materialist and determinist ideologies of the twentieth century, Marxism and the Washington Consensus, successively decreed that the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the market were inevitable, the future is actually indeterminate. It may be that deep economic and social currents create the framework of history, but those currents can be channeled, eddied, or even reversed by circumstance, chance and human agency. We have only to reflect upon defunct glacial despotisms such as the USSR or East Germany to realize that nothing is forever.Throughout history, state systems with outsized pretensions to power have reacted to their environments in two ways. The first strategy, reflecting the ossification of its ruling elites, consists of repeating that nothing is wrong, that the status quo reflects the nation s unique good fortune in being favored by God and that those calling for change are merely subversive troublemakers. As the French ancien r gime, the Romanov dynasty and the Habsburg emperors discovered, the strategy works splendidly for a while, particularly if one has a talent for dismissing unpleasant facts. The final results, however, are likely to be thoroughly disappointing.The second strategy is one embraced to varying degrees and with differing goals, by figures of such contrasting personalities as Mustafa Kemal Atat rk, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Charles de Gaulle and Deng Xiaoping. They were certainly not revolutionaries by temperament; if anything, their natures were conservative. But they understood that the political cultures in which they lived were fossilized and incapable of adapting to the times. In their drive to reform and modernize the political systems they inherited, their first obstacles to overcome were the outworn myths that encrusted the thinking of the elites of their time.As the United States confronts its future after experiencing two failed wars, a precarious economy and $17 trillion in accumulated debt, the national punditry has split into two camps. The first, the declinists, sees a broken, dysfunctional political system incapable of reform and an economy soon to be overtaken by China. The second, the reformers, offers a profusion of nostrums to turn the nation around: public financing of elections to sever the artery of money between the corporate components of the Deep State and financially dependent elected officials, government  insourcing  to reverse the tide of outsourcing of government functions and the conflicts of interest that it creates, a tax policy that values human labor over financial manipulation and a trade policy that favors exporting manufactured goods over exporting investment capital.All of that is necessary, but not sufficient. The Snowden revelations (the impact of which have been surprisingly strong), the derailed drive for military intervention in Syria and a fractious Congress, whose dysfunction has begun to be a serious inconvenience to the Deep State, show that there is now a deep but as yet inchoate hunger for change. What America lacks is a figure with the serene self-confidence to tell us that the twin idols of national security and corporate power are outworn dogmas that have nothing more to offer us. Thus disenthralled, the people themselves will unravel the Deep State with surprising speed. [1] The term  Deep State  was coined in Turkey and is said to be a system composed of high-level elements within the intelligence services, military, security, judiciary and organized crime. In British author John le Carr s latest novel, A Delicate Truth, a character describes the Deep State as   the ever-expanding circle of non-governmental insiders from banking, industry and commerce who were cleared for highly classified information denied to large swathes of Whitehall and Westminster.  I use the term to mean a hybrid association of elements of government and parts of top-level finance and industry that is effectively able to govern the United States without reference to the consent of the governed as expressed through the formal political process.  [2] Twenty-five years ago, the sociologist Robert Nisbet described this phenomenon as  the attribute of No Fault . Presidents, secretaries and generals and admirals in America seemingly subscribe to the doctrine that no fault ever attaches to policy and operations. This No Fault conviction prevents them from taking too seriously such notorious foul-ups as Desert One, Grenada, Lebanon and now the Persian Gulf.  To his list we might add 9/11, Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya.  [3] The attitude of many members of Congress towards Wall Street was memorably expressed by Rep. Spencer Bachus (R-AL), the incoming chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, in 2010:  In Washington, the view is that the banks are to be regulated, and my view is that Washington and the regulators are there to serve the banks.   [4] Beginning in 1988, every US president has been a graduate of Harvard or Yale. Beginning in 2000, every losing presidential candidate has been a Harvard or Yale graduate, with the exception of John McCain in 2008.  [5] In recent months, the American public has seen a vivid example of a Deep State operative marketing his ideology under the banner of pragmatism. Former Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates   a one-time career CIA officer and deeply political Bush family retainer   has camouflaged his retrospective defense of military escalations that have brought us nothing but casualties and fiscal grief as the straight-from-the-shoulder memoir from a plain-spoken son of Kansas who disdains Washington and its politicians.  [6] Meanwhile, the US government took the lead in restoring Baghdad s sewer system at a cost of $7 billion.  [7] Obama s abrupt about-face suggests he may have been skeptical of military intervention in Syria all along, but only dropped that policy once Congress and Putin gave him the running room to do so. In 2009, he went ahead with the Afghanistan  surge  partly because General Petraeus  public relations campaign and back-channel lobbying on the Hill for implementation of his pet military strategy pre-empted other options. These incidents raise the disturbing question of how much the democratically elected president   or any president   sets the policy of the national security state and how much the policy is set for him by the professional operatives of that state who engineer faits accomplis that force his hand.*** Author Mike Lofgren is a former career congressional staff member who served on the House and Senate budget committees.

 Hawaii Does What Republicans Won’t And Reduces The NRA To Wetting Themselves In Fear,"All Republicans had to do is ban suspected terrorists from buying guns and pass a universal background checks law. But they chose to listen to the NRA, and now states like Hawaii are bringing the hammer down on guns.The American people are demanding legislative action to prevent future mass shootings and reduce the number of gun violence incidents in this country. Simple fixes like universal background checks and banning terrorist suspects from buying guns legally would have satisfied most Americans.But because Republicans are owned by the NRA they refused to act and now all gun owners are paying the price for their failure to be responsible.Hawaii has the lowest gun death rate of any state in the nation and the island chain s strict gun laws are the main reason why.And now Governor David Ige has signed three bills that take gun regulations to another level.Introduced by Democratic state Rep. Will Espero, SB 2954 requires police to place the names of gun owners in the state in the FBI monitoring database so that law enforcement in Hawaii will be informed if any of their residents commit a crime wherever they go in the United States. So if a Hawaiian commits a crime in New York the police in Hawaii will be notified so they can determine if that person should still get to be in possession of firearms.In addition, HB 625 stalking and sexual harassment now disqualify people who commit these crimes from buying guns and HB 2632 requires people who have been diagnosed with major mental disorders to surrender their guns to authorities.In all, these three measures make it clear that Hawaii is done taking shit from the NRA.Of course, it didn t take long for the NRA to whine about the bills. The NRA Institute for Legislative Action, which really should change that last word to  Inaction,  predictably condemned the new laws. The exercise of an individual s Second Amendment rights is not inherently suspicious and should not require a person to surrender other civil liberties, including unwarranted invasions of privacy or unequal treatment under the law. The lawful acquisition, possession, carrying, or use of a firearm does not justify subjecting citizens to ongoing monitoring. Sorry, NRA. But that s what happens when you refuse to do anything reasonable to prevent gun violence other than offering  thoughts and prayers.  If you can t agree on anything to keep guns solely in the hands of responsible citizens, the government has the power and the right to do it without your support.NRA spokesperson Amy Hunter complained that the laws go too far, which is coming from an organization that believes ANY law restricting guns goes too far. As you can imagine, the NRA finds this one of the most extreme bills we ve ever seen,  she whined.At this point, if the NRA and their Republican puppets continue to refuse to do anything reasonable to reduce gun violence in this country, the states should do whatever it takes to make everyone as safe from gun violence as possible, even if it means putting every gun owner on an FBI list. Rep. Espero understands this and he s also a gun owner.Republicans and the NRA only have themselves to blame for not agreeing to be reasonable in the first place. They had a chance to DO something and they failed spectacularly. Now it s up to the states and Hawaii is setting an example for other states to follow.Featured image via Guns Wikia"
McPain: John McCain Furious That Iran Treated US Sailors Well,"21st Century Wire says As 21WIRE reported earlier this week, the unlikely  mishap  of two US Naval vessels straying into Iranian waters   just hours before the President s State of the Union speech, followed by the usual parade of arch-neocons coming on TV in real time to declare the incident as  an act of aggression  by Iran against the United States   is no mere coincidence.24 hours after the incident, the Iranians returned all 11 US sailors, unharmed and in good spirits. The only remaining casualty from this event was an incident of a common condition in Washington known as  Pre-Traumatic Stress Disorder    suffered by a certain US Senator was mortified by the uneventful outcome which followed Daniel McAdams Ron Paul Institute  The two US Navy riverine command boats intercepted in Iranian territorial waters yesterday were sent on their way along with the crew of 10 US sailors after brief detention on Iranian soil.According to news reports, the well-armed warships either suffered mechanical or navigational difficulties which caused them to enter Iranian territory (although it may well have been a game of cat-and-mouse to test the Iranian response). The US sailors were apparently treated well, enjoyed what appeared a decent meal in relaxed surroundings, and in the end apologized for the mistake and praised their treatment by the Iranians. Thanks to President Obama s policy shift on Iran toward engagement and away from isolationism, Secretary of State John Kerry was able to telephone his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Zarif and quickly defuse what just months ago would have been a far more serious situation.This should be a good-news story about the value of diplomacy and reducing tensions with adversaries, but Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) was having none of it. That Kerry expressed his appreciation to the Iranians for swiftly releasing the American sailors only showed the Obama Administration s  craven desire to preserve the dangerous Iranian nuclear deal at all costs evidently knows no limit,  said McCain in a press release.McCain was furious that  Obama administration officials seem to be falling over themselves to offer praise for Iran s graciousness  and was outraged that the Iranians dared interfere with the actions of US military vessels operating in Iranian waters.In the world of John McCain, only the United States has the right to national sovereignty. The US military has the right to act anywhere and everywhere and the rest of the world dare not raise a question.According to McCain,  sovereign immune naval vessels are exempt from detention, boarding, or search. Their crews are not subject to detention or arrest. Imagine the tune McCain would have been singing if a well-armed Iranian naval vessel had been spotted in US territorial waters off the coast of New York. Would he have so rigorously condemned any US interference in the actions of Iran s sovereign naval vessels?Leave it to some clever Twitterers to post an example of the difference between US and Iranian detention.Copyright   2016 by RonPaul Institute.

 GOP Lawmaker: ‘A Lady Needs To Be Told When She’s Being Nasty’,"A Texas lawmaker just defended Donald Trump s remark toward Hillary Clinton during the third and final presidential debate. Clinton was discussing Social Security and Medicare when Donald interrupted her to say the Democratic presidential nominee is  such a nasty woman.  Apparently Rep. Brian Babin (R-TX) agrees with Donald. You know what, she s saying some nasty things,  Babin told Alan Colmes on this show. You think it s appropriate to call her a nasty woman?  Colmes asked. Well, I m a genteel Southerner, Alan,  Babin replied. So that means no?  Colmes asked. The radio host had to repeatedly press Babin to answer the question. You re ducking me, Congressman,  Colmes said when Babit tried to pivot the topic to immigration. No, I think sometimes a lady needs to be told when she s being nasty. Oh, really?  Colmes asked.Babin replied,  I do. My assessment is that Mrs. Clinton has got so much baggage,  Babin continued.  I think she s done some nasty things. Colmes asked Babin about Trump s  rigged  election  rhetoric.  We re going to have to agree to disagree,  Babin said.The Texas lawmaker went on to blame the media for Trump s negative coverage.Colmes asked who he thought would win in November.  Im sure hoping that Mr. Trump wins,  Babin said.Audio courtesy of CNN:Babin initially backed Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) but later threw his support behind the GOP presidential nominee.We re glad that Babin brought up  nasty things.  Trump was recently outed in a video bragging about sexually assaulting women in 1995. Since then, he s gone on to call women fat, slobs, pigs and dogs. He s attacked his sexual assault accusers  looks. The man-baby candidate is whipping his supporters into a frenzy by telling crowds that the election is  rigged.   Trump is a Nasty Man. But thank you, Babin, for mansplaining that women need to be put in their place.The word  genteel  doesn t mean what the Texas lawmaker thinks it means.Image: Gage Skidmore via Flickr"
